The Avatar The Avatar is a digital identity represented by a soulmate NFT that brings all the digital fingerprints of a user in a unified entity. These digital fingerprints include 3D anatomies, and on-chain and off-chain data.  The Avatar is a portable, persistent, non-corruptible, and verifiable digital identity that captures web3 values like decentralization and pseudo-anonymity.

Avatars are the creators of the Gamium metaverse; they can build whatever they want through the Gamium SDK.  Genesis is the center of the Gamium world, where you can find the Gamium buildings. These buildings contain unique applications like Decentralized chats, 3D calling apps, DeFi Applications, and Jobs portals. In Genesis, you will also find immersive experiences and exclusive events. Outside of Genesis, there are Islands, places for Avatars to live and build whatever they want. Using the Gamium SDK into their LAND, Avatars can build their house, create 3D objects, create exclusive events, integrate their e-commerce store, advertise or rent their space, and many more.  The SDK also allow Avatars to monetize and integrate any application into the Gamium world, converting Gamium into the App Store of the metaverse. The possibilities are infinite.

AdaSwap strives to be the pillar supporting the growth of the Cardano ecosystem (ADA token), by providing the best swap protocol and NFT marketplace alongside the tools to help users build the Cardano DeFi space. AdaSwap and AdaNFT will use acquisition tools unseen by the Cardano (ADA) chain to create a new generation of stakeholders. The cross-chain ASW token and partnerships with various market leaders like COTI, Shima Capital and GBV, among others, will help AdaSwap bring volume from other blockchains. HOW DOES ADASWAP (ASW) WORK? AdaSwap is a start to a trustless decentralized exchange (DEX) coupled with an ultra-fast gas-less automated market maker (AMM). As this new ecosystem opens, the users and businesses that chooses to operate on the Cardano blockchain will have a great and pressing need for The following financial services: Token Swap Staking PoolsYield Farming AdaNFT NFT marketplaces suffer from a lack of originality and creativity causing a flood in the market of copies and uninspired work. AdaSwap knows NFTs are more than just art, NFTs are capable of tokenizing and capturing the ownership and other rights of a digital asset that can be freely exchanged on open markets. The above provides several advantages, such as strong data assurance, ownership protection, counterfeit immunity, and evidence-based uniqueness, which are extremely powerful in removing many of the risk friction costs that would normally accompany digital asset ownership, paving the way for access to markets and opening up previously locked and illiquid capital. In addition, what is being seen now in the NFT space is certainly just the beginning, AdaSwap will drive NFT exchange to the next frontier.  The first product will be an exclusive and curated NFT marketplace, AdaSwap holders will be awarded tiers through a tier system allowing voting rights, this will allow users to vote on innovative initiatives and what NFT launches they will want to see next.   WHAT MAKES ADASWAP (ASW) UNIQUE? In the whole world, the current market competitor is SundaeSwap. Its website is suffering from the concurrency issue of the blockchain not allowing them to process more than 150 transactions per block. This has driven a lot of traffic away from the project due to the heavy delays. AdaSwap’s offering is different - the ADA Cardano-based DEX will be gamified and closely linked to the NFT marketplace to attract users. The NFT marketplace will not suffer from the concurrency issue allowing for quick transactions and the DEX will be launched on an L2 solution that will not suffer from the concurrency issues. The DEX will be the pillar of the DeFi ecosystem for the Cardano Network.  ADASWAP (ASW) PRODUCT ROADMAP  ADASWAP (ASW) REVENUE STREAMS  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES ADASWAP (ASW) USE? The team has been innovative in its ways of solving the concurrency issue and non-functions plutos backend plaguing the Cardano network. The DEX is currently being developed and deployed using a layer 2 scaling solution.  The NFT marketplace is set to use a Multi-signature wallet solution that has passed legal opinions in both Switzerland and Israel assuring its security and legality allowing for us to hold users' NFTs and provide optimal transaction times. ADASWAP (ASW) MARKETING STRATEGY The current market mentality of native Cardano projects is to exploit current Cardano supporters instead of creating new ones. This model presents a major problem, by placing too much focus on TVL incentives aiming to create a lock of capital for participants, fellow projects are halting active participation and trade volume.  As the No1 NFT marketplace on Cardano, they will allow users to purchase exclusive NFTs that will be endorsed by celebrity figures and brands. Their exclusive drops will help draw attraction to both the platform and the Cardano space. The AdaSwap (ASW) token sale (IDO) is set to happen on DAO Maker, the #1 investment launchpad. You have a chance to invest into ASW tokens during the Public IDO or during the Private Sale Round for DAO token holders. The current market competitors develop utilizing Cardano ADA believers and fail to look towards other blockchains for attracting swap volume. AdaSwap (ASW) will start as a decentalized cross-chain token to not only build a higher level of trade volume but then bring these cross-chain buyers over to Cardano with great utilities and incentives.  AdaSwap will also have great protocols to drive participation such as the Free Financial Model, where no transaction fees are charged on ASW based swaps or the so-called stake-and-forget protocol that will create an automated airdrop system through staking pools to help users diversify their portfolio.	4740	0.0016877637130801688	0.0002109704641350211	0.0014767932489451476

DragonSB is the first metaverse MMORPG built on Terra Protocol and Binance Smart Chain Platform. DragonSB is built in Unreal Engine 4.26 – A famous game engine of Epic Gaming. DragonSB's dev team chose UE4 to develop the game because of the in-game experiences that this game engine brings, such as running smoothly, with a bit of stutter, the visual effects are good, and it's less resource-consuming for the gaming device.  Another strong point of UE4 is that game development can use Blueprint or C++. This reduces the release time of updates - using Blueprint - and the game runs smoother - since the Blueprint will be compiled into C++ to run.  DRAGONSB MARKETING STRATEGY DragonSB is an ecosystem that combines Games, Swap, and NFT Marketplace. Integrating the markets makes DragonSB a ground-breaking GameFi with massive growth potential. DragonSB's objective is to increase the number of community users, attract true gamers and grow partner networks such as investment funds, advisors, backers, etc.  DragonSB's marketing activities will be divided into three stages: IDO, Marketplace, and Open Beta. In the IDO stage, they will primarily provide early users with information about DragonSB, draw the attention of players and investors about the upcoming IDO, and demonstrate the development potential and attractiveness of the project judgment. Some marketing activities will be carried out in the IDO stage:  Building Community by running events such as Airdrop, Giveaway, and Bounty to catch users' attention.Holding AMA sessions to interact with the community and support their concerns about the project; instructing users for participating in DragonSB's whitelist and IDOHighly focused on KOL Marketing, Press Media, and Social Media Marketing to enhance Brand Awareness.  After the IDO stage, the team will keep on carrying out KOL Marketing and Press Media; holding AMA series and events like Press Conference, Launching Countdown, Bounty, Giveaway, etc. to maintain the relationship between DragonSB and Community; shilling on a massive scale on social media platforms to create the FOMO effect to acquire new players and increase interaction with their community.  Simultaneously, DragonSB will regularly organize in-game events with attractive rewards and creative campaigns to promote essential contributions from the community.

4	defiato	600000	2	DeFi	other	 MarketMaker.io 	0.0	1.0	defiato	16/12/20	ethereum	92	12	"WHAT IS DEFIATO? DeFiato is the next-generation centralized platform for Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It aims to bring DeFi services to mainstream users without technical barriers and financial risk associated with decentralized platforms. The current on-chain farming, staking, and lending/borrowing present various technical barriers, while off-chain activities face liquidity issues, fiat restrictions, lack of a central multichain support crypto assets and institutional-grade custodians. DeFiato solves these challenges by offering One-Click-to-Farm proprietary technology, ease of fiat access and exchange-grade security, to effectively eliminate technical barriers and financial risks. It provides a user experience similar to centralized services, such as high security, quick settlements and customer service support, making it a pioneer in Centralised Decentralised Finance (CeDeFi). DeFiato is on its way to becoming a leading cross-chain aggregator. It currently supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche and Solana. On a single platform, users can simply deposit their crypto assets from one chain, and immediately be able to earn rewards from various farms on any of these chains, hence reducing touchpoints such as bridges/wormholes that could result in human errors and cyber attacks. DeFiato will also be introducing fiat on- and off-ramp. Users can transfer fiat from their bank to purchase stable coins, swap them for tokens and start earning rewards – all on DeFiato. They can also cash out seamlessly without leaving the platform. DeFiato helps users earn money without facing technical challenges and fearing the loss of funds. Users can simply trust the platform process, farm and forget with DeFiato. WHAT MAKES DEFIATO UNIQUE? There are no exact competitors as the majority of competitors are mostly crypto structured products or ""crypto neo banks"" that provide mainstream users access to crypto but not DeFi. You can see immediately from DeFiato's UI/UX that it is focused on fundamental DeFi services, rather than just simple APY generation native to many of these wallets/products. Just from a very practical point of view, users will see 10% maybe 15% APYs on these competitors as they are native products, but for Defiato, you have access to the full spectrum of DeFi, which can go up to 4 digits APYs. The key, of course, is that they do it safely and only work with well audited and blue-chip smart contracts. Another key difference is that Defiato is totally cross-chain and essentially provides a service as a bridge. Whereas most other competitors are single-chain focused (e.g Ethereum) and do not intend to increase the offerings. Those that may allow for more chains are just acting as wallets, and currently do not provide users with the option to enter DeFi services within their apps. DEFIATO PRODUCT ROADMAP  DEFIATO REVENUE STREAMS  DEFIATO PRODUCT DIVE How to swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRJu-no1_tg How to farm (One-Click-To-Farm): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2motb1CrFo How to unfarm (One-Click-To-Unfarm): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0G2pb3GmpU WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES DEFIATO USE? The key proposition is building on an exchange-graded framework to process smart contracts in the DeFi space as an intermediary on behalf of the user. With the use of internal rund reconciliation tools, the platform is able to quickly perform liquid cross-chain transference so that the user can seamlessly perform front-end functions without the ostensible requirement to bridge between chains. The platform secures funds safely via hot/cold wallet processes. As DeFiato is an aggregator, it is then required from the start for the platform to have full capabilities to support not just EVM chains (in which it currently has 4 supported) but also non-EVM chains the likes of Solana (supported) and even Terra and more (coming soon). All these chains have their associated DeFi dApps numbering the hundreds, which the team will effectively include and onboard in a reasonable and safe manner for the benefit of users. DEFIATO MARKETING STRATEGY DeFiato's open beta platform was launched in Aug 2021. Since then it has attracted 15,000 KYC'd users and a TVL of US$21M with minimum marketing efforts. Since Jan 2022, serious marketing efforts have been kick-started by conducting numerous AMAs across global, Vietnam, China and Korea communities. They plan to continue their community engagement efforts by sharing and demonstrating the wide suite of DeFi services to the public. As DeFiato is a DeFi aggregator, there are practically no limits to what DeFi services can be integrated on the platform as long as they fulfill all safety audits and represent significant user demand. So by forming a large ecosystem of partners and supporters DeFiato will inherit a large share of voices to spread its mission. To accelerate the growth of mainstream user adoption and unlock the next trillion dollars in DeFi space, Defiato will be conducting a massive push via steady content production and potentially paid promotion to be the go-to platform when mainstream users wish to enter DeFi. The ambition is to become the household brand for DeFi services. DEFIATO TOKEN ECONOMY  "	5236	0.0003819709702062643	0.0005729564553093965	0.0030557677616501145

The BBS Network is a public network of interconnected message boards (nostalgically called BBS, for Bulletin Board System), where all critical data is kept on-chain and every post is an NFT. The BBS token can be used to purchase ad space across the entire network as well as be staked to govern the network. Mining BBS tokens is done by generating verifiable engagement on user-created BBSes. In a sense, BBS Network can be likened to a ""decentralized Reddit"", spread across multiple domains to prevent censorship, while maintaining a network effect and openness for anyone to build upon. End-users are rewarded based on their contribution, weighted with their traditional social media clout, in order to incentivise the migration of influencers. Ad revenues are distributed automatically to the post publishers, content curators and board moderators, rewarding contributing members financially and encouraging healthy community alignment. A pre-launch version of BBS is currently being piloted at bbs.market with more than 10,000 weekly visitors to multiple pilot BBSes. BBS MARKETING STRATEGY In order to bootstrap the BBS network, 50% of BBS tokens will be distributed each day over multiple years to BBSes, based on the user engagement they generate relative to the rest of the network. Engagement is defined in this context as ""Real Users generating Real Content generating Real Impressions"". Measuring Users Members of the BBS system are encouraged, through their daily bonuses, to link their social accounts from YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, and other popular social networks. Daily bonus amounts are based on the member accounts' Social Capital (representing the members' followers, friends, karma, etc.) in order to attract high-profile members as well as to prevent fraud. Measuring Engagement The engagement generated by a specific BBS is simply the total number of post views by registered users on that BBS. Only registered members are counted to incentivise BBSes that have real and engaged communities.. Daily Distribution Logic The daily BBS token allocation for each specific BBS is calculated as follows: Daily Token Distribution * (Engagement on the BBS / Total Engagement on the BBS network) The BBS token distribution to BBSes is executed in the form of ad purchases by the BBS DAO. The DAO may also resale some of the purchased inventory to 3rd parties. BBS Blacklist A BBS Blacklist is used to deter attempts to fraudulently gain BBS tokens from the engagement mining by faking user activity. To start mining tokens, a BBS has to maintain the number of daily impressions by registered users above a (X) threshold for (Y) days.  The X and Y values are set via the BBS governance voting process to make sure that eligible BBSes can be realistically reviewed by the community prior to receiving BBS tokens. Through the governance system, BBSes can be added or removed from the blacklist. Blacklisted BBSes are ignored in the daily token allocation process. This mechanic incentivizes existing BBS owners to review, detect and report any fraudulent activity sooner rather than later in order to prevent the fraudsters from taking any share from their daily token distribution. WHAT MAKES BBS UNIQUE? Today's message board services are each operated by a single corporate entity while BBS Network is an ecosystem of contributing entities and participants. Each BBS can be owned and operated by a different entity, which can feature different channels and set different terms of use, while all BBSes remain tightly integrated through leveraging a single common blockchain. Modern blockchain technology makes it possible to store BBS Network data such as user accounts, posts, replies and reactions on a shared public ledger. This architecture opens up read and write access to all BBS Network data for all ecosystem participants - very much unlike today's dominating platform monopolies that ultimately controls who sees what, when and why. Every post across the BBS network is an NFT that can be minted on different blockchains to be traded on NFT marketplaces as soon as the initial bidding process ends (24h after posting).  The BBS members bid using a BBS-specific community currency that is awarded to them for engaging and promoting the BBS. NFT holders are featured on the post and generate earnings from owning popular posts. They may also choose to list their NFTs for sale at any point.  The network is made up of potentially infinite BBSes (Bulletin Board Services or message boards) where every BBS in the network is a full Reddit-like service, with any number of channels, users, comments and community features. All BBSes are interlinked and interoperable because their data resides on a public blockchain with which any developer or user can interact. The ecosystem consists of the following parties: Developers can build new UX, product components, and features that any operator can choose to host. deWeb LTD is the first developer building the core software for the BBS Network.Operators host developers' BBS software to serve any number of BBSes. Currently, several operators offer BBS hosting globally.BBS Owners use the operators' services to launch their own BBS under a shared or their own domain. BBS Owners manage the community, customer support, branding, marketing and other customizations. Currently, several BBS owners, mostly influencers and content creators, have launched their own pilot BBS, utilizing the infrastructure provided by several BBS operators. The BBS network uses a distributed identity and authentication model, similar in nature to the model used by the global email network, where the members' home domain is associated with their unique ID (i.e. [email protected]). However, BBS members have full control over their accounts through digital signatures and can change their home BBS at any time.

Hubble will offer multiple DeFi services as the protocol and DeFi continue to mature and expand. Hubble begins its DeFi journey in Phase 1 with a focus on borrowing and minting USDH. Users can deposit multiple kinds of crypto assets like SOL, BTC, ETH, and others to borrow up to 90.9% LTV in USDH. While borrowing, users can earn yield on their deposits. These loans are guaranteed through a Stability Pool of USDH deposits made by Stability Pool providers who pay off bad loans and earn the ~10% difference in liquidated assets. In addition, users who deposit USDH in the Stability Pool earn HBB, Hubble's governance token. HBB stakers earn 85% of the protocol's fees. In the next phases of Hubble's planned roadmap, they will launch additional services to increase the utility of the platform. In Phase 2, Hubble will launch structured products, and in Phase3 they will begin offering undercollateralized loans. DeFi is a relatively new financial system, and, as DeFi continues to grow, Hubble seeks to adapt with the changing market and provide the products that will make DeFi a source of financial services for the whole world. WHAT MAKES HUBBLE PROTOCOL (HBB) UNIQUE? Hubble is something like Maker DAO and Liquity on Ethereum, but being on Solana means using Hubble requires much lower transaction fees and Rust powered smart contracts allow for multiple asset deposits that can generate yield for users while being borrowed against. Borrowing: Hubble Protocol is an innovative crypto loan solution with a zero interest, where your crypto assets work for you while being collateralized. More information could be found Hubble company website: https://blog.hubbleprotocol.io/hubble-defi-borrowing-solana/ USDH: Any Hubble Protocol user is enabled to earn yield with their collateralized assets even after they have used those assets to borrow USDH. More information could be found Hubble company website: https://blog.hubbleprotocol.io/stablecoins-hubble-usdh/ Stability Pool/liquidations:  Users who deposit in the Stability Pool help to keep the protocol healthy and thus are rewarded in collateralized tokens from liquidations, with a discount of approximately ten percent. Also they are getting an additional encouragement in the form of Hubble (HBB) tokens. The stability pool helps cover bad debt and repay loans on Hubble. When liquidations occur, users who deposit USDH into the stability pool receive their fair share of around 10% of the leftover collateral after loan repayment. More information could be found on the Hubble company website: https://blog.hubbleprotocol.io/democratizing-liquidations-with-hubbles-lending-protocol/ As for now Hubble accepts deposits of seven assets as collateral: Solana (SOL), SOL tokens with Marinade (mSOL), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), FTX (FTT), Raydium (RAY), and Serum (SRM). In the future Hubble plans to whitelist more tokens. HUBBLE PROTOCOL (HBB) ROADMAP After the IDO on DAO Maker, Hubble's goal is to provide a one-stop shop for essential DeFi services powered by the speed and efficiency of Solana's network. Hubble is the product of years of experience in FinTech and a passion for mainstreaming DeFi for the world. They hope to expand our services to meet the needs of the growing worldwide peer-to-peer financial system that is DeFi. Hubble (HBB) plans to stay in the DeFi space for a long time. Some projects are here for a day and gone tomorrow, but Hubble isn't one of those projects. The DeFi landscape is constantly shifting, and new innovations are invigorating this space all the time. During each phase of development, additional revenue streams will be added to the rewards earned by HBB stakers. HUBBLE PROTOCOL REVENUE STREAMS  Rust smart contracts were developed from scratch and will be audited by three different security firms: Kudelski, Arcadia, and Smart State. HUBBLE PROTOCOL (HBB) MARKETING STRATEGY The Hubble IDO happens on DAO Maker. They intend to build a solid DeFi community, spark interest of new users about DeFi and the utility of borrowing against crypto assets to mint USDH. Onboard large investors from the ecosystem who see capital value in using Hubble Protocol and HBB. Increase awareness of, and use-cases for, USDH as a censorship-resistant stablecoin through strategic partnerships on Solana. The token IDO for Hubble Protocol (HBB) is set to happen on DAO Maker launchpad before listing on exchanges. Add DAO token to your portfolio to have a chance at allocations in the HBB token IDO.

The goal of the project is to provide an enjoyable gaming experience to people that play traditional games, but combine that audience with the crypto community. Using the ISKY token and in-game NFTs they provide a refreshing take on traditional video games that currently have yet to properly tap into the potential demand within the crypto community. The project is a desktop application that will be running on Windows/MacOS and Linux at launch, Infinity Skies currently keeps the possibility of expanding to the mobile and console markets. The Infinity Skies website is a intertwined project with the game application, where it exists to facilitate the game in terms of account and wallet management and most importantly it will host the Infinity Skies NFT marketplace, that in the future will look to open up to other start-up gaming studios. Game mechanics of ""Infinity Skies"" enables players to build, socialize, trade, and undertake numerous adventures. Players will compete to build the most prestigious castle in the community while collecting rare NFT decorations, skins, and building components. They own their island in the sky on which they can build their castle and allow other users to visit their prestigious castle island in the sky. The ultimate goal is to become the King of Infinity Skies. WHAT MAKES INFINITY SKIES UNIQUE? Many competitors in the space focus a lot on the short term profits of early sales, marketing and pre-alpha development. Infinity Skies took the approach to put a more heavy emphasis on development early on, just getting by with seed capital and some minor early promotional events (although these are mainly for community building). Now (Q4 2021) that they're going comfortably into the development phase Infinity Skies will begin to really ramp up the marketing and promotion. They feel this will allow them to deliver a working product sooner than their competitors who are wasting lots of valuable development time on marketing builds, promotional material and assets too early on in their development. With their current team size of around 23 employees excluding the founders they believe it is very possible to sustain development financially up to the first playable build and get there before any of their competitors will be able to launch anything as playable as their product. This ultimately means that unlike their competitors they won't be seeing huge profits for themselves early on, but a much healthier token launch and growth combined with bigger company profits from a long term perspective. The following is a comparison of projects on an individual basis and look at some more technical aspects. The Sandbox: The Sandbox game is pushing more of a focus on land sales currently. Creating hype around the sale of land pieces. One significant difference between Infinity Skies and Sandbox is the intricateness of their NFTs and the transparent distinction of the level of graphics. The Sandbox has also been around for many years which explains their large following. However, with how long they have been in the business their following and brand awareness is not what it should be. Infinity Skies will compete with this by creating marketing strategies around their branding in order to build an audience much faster. My Neighbor Alice: This project is implementing land lottery rather than land sale at the beginning. Instead of pieces of land going to the highest bidder they will be initially going through a lottery process. When it comes to graphics this project is more of a cartoon style design. Infinity Skies deviates from this by creating a much more vibrant world with their NFT designs and the intricacy of their graphics. They have spent much more time on creating every detail of their products down to small items, like chests and bookcases. Axie Infinity: One creative difference with this project is the ability to ""Battle"" in their worlds. Their project is also Pokemon-inspired which varies from other types of competitors. The key difference between Axie and a traditional game is that Blockchain economic design is used to reward their players for their contributions to the ecosystem. This new model of gaming has been dubbed ""play to earn"". When it comes to their competitive edge with Axie it will again rely on their backend development. Decentraland: Was founded in 2017 which has led to having a larger following on social channels than most other competitors. One of the flaws with Decentraland is its unpolished look. ""Long story short: Decentraland is an ambitious virtual world with an unpolished feel.""https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/56656/decentraland-ethereum-virtual-world-review. The issue with several of these projects is their desire to push launching the virtual worlds faster than they should. At InfinitySkies they are placing a very high value on the developmental stages of their world, game and token. The difference between Infinity Skies and Decentraland is the former's desire to make sure the product is fully functioning and filled with a versatile virtual world that will keep their customers coming back. Alien Worlds: Focuses more on NFT cards within their system. From a graphic standpoint Infinity Skies is cleaner and more refined. Another issue with Alien Worlds is an early push through development. Infinity Skies will compete with them by creating a better, easier-to-navigate product and a more seamless marketplace. Infinity Skies is a game of the sandbox genre, where people are able to set their own short-term and long-term goals. The game mechanics are designed in such a way however, that several long-term goals are incentivized for players to work towards. These goals are:  Building a castle/island to attain castle rank/votes for a high standing on the social leaderboard in order to reap NFT rewards.  Collecting numerous rare and unique NFT's as possible.  Turn your time into money with our cryptocurrency “Skyblocks”, by trading in NFTs with other players, using the marketplace. HOW DOES INFINITY SKIES WORK? Camera view: Top-view Isometric. Genre: Sandbox/Creative Core gameplay: Competitive, Creative, Social, Casual, Exploration, Achievement-focused. The game takes inspiration from games such as The Sims and Habbo Hotel in terms of building and socializing, but draws inspiration from roguelite games such as Hades and Diablo for the adventure mode. Infinity Skies is divided into four distinct categories of play that define the core gameplay: Build, Socialize(Explore), Trade, Adventure. Building: In Infinity Skies players build their own castles using NFT furniture, walls and floors on top of their own floating Island (NFT) in the sky. Players can obtain NFTs through trading or adventuring and then use those NFTs to build their castle, preparing it to be as pleasant of an experience for visitors. This category of play is heavily incentivized through their social leaderboard rewards and achievements that can result in a lucrative value gain of NFTs/ISKY. Socializing: Players walk around castles using a customizable (NFTs) avatar, and are able to see other player's avatars walking around the same castle that they are visiting. They can interact with others by chatting and or mini-games if the castle's NFTs allow it. Upon leaving a visited castle a player (who already obtained the required player rank for voting) can leave a vote for that castle in order to boost it on the monthly social leaderboard. Various lucrative NFT rewards are granted to the top 1000 every month, with the top 3 receiving a percentage of the NFT trading royalties. This incentivizes players to build a pretty castle using NFTs and to provide a pleasant visitor experience. Castles are set to the public setting by default. When a castle is set to private, other players can only visit the castle if the host invites them. Guilds also play a major part in the socializing aspect of the game, essentially the game provides a framework for Gaming Guilds to operate in. People can band together in an in-game guild for a more structured approach to obtaining castle votes. Every guild member stands to benefit through the guild leaderboard, which is an addition to the individual leaderboard where guilds are ranked based on all votes collected by all members combined. Rewards are distributed to members (e.g. to the top ranking castle) in the form of ISKY. Trading: Trading is one of the ways for players to acquire NFTs, they can purchase NFTs from other players using ISKY on their marketplace or they can sell them to other players to gain ISKY. The Infinity Skies marketplace will grant an excellent accuracy within the user experience to the users that want to search for specific NFTs within specific categories or rarities amongst the thousands of NFTs that are listed. Adventuring: Adventuring is the primary way that NFTs get into circulation, as slaying enemies in adventure mode will award the player with Valor Badges. These Valor Badges can be exchanged for ERC-20 ""Fragment"" Tokens that can be used for fusing crystal NFTs. Embarking on an adventure requires no upfront investment of ISKY or any other currency by the player, making this a profitable play-to-earn mechanic for free-to-play players. These adventures require a tactical mindset for the player, who will be challenged with dealing with random encounters that can either be devastating or beneficial to the progress of their adventure. Adventures make use of the roguelite genre format, meaning that failure is more likely than success, but ultimately through skilled navigation of the environment and events the player will be very satisfied with completing an adventure. Innovative NFT Gameplay mechanics: Players will have the option to use Feast NFTs (a commonly dropped, high supply, NFT with high demand due to game balance and burn feature), these NFTs will be very profitable to farm for free-to-play players that engage in adventures. And highly demanded by people engaging in the social leaderboard gameplay. The demand for this burnable NFT is driven by the mechanic it enables for the player that burns the NFT; burning the NFT boosts the user's castle to the top of the castle lobby interface, making their castle more visible and more easily found by visitors, which hopefully results in more votes for the user's castle. Crafting is another innovative mechanic that utilizes blockchain technology to allow the player to burn multiple NFTs of the same rarity in exchange for one higher rarity NFT. Because of this it was important to implement a feature set that allows these NFTs to hold value and not stagnate the economy. This makes it so that NFTs that are in oversupply due to randomized drop chances will always retain some value since they can be burned into a higher rarity NFT. WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES INFINITY SKIES USE? VRF Technology Infinity Skies is using various innovative mechanisms that are new in the space. The treasure chest (random loot box) system and crafting system (burning multiple NFTs for a random higher rarity) are innovative on-chain mechanisms that use Chainlink's VRF system in innovative ways on BSC. More information regarding this in this article where they are quoted: https://www.binance.org/en/blog/chainlink-vrf-is-live-on-binance-smart-chain-bringing-verifiable-randomness-to-bsc-developers/ NFT Gaming Assets NFT assets are new to the space in the sense that there will be thousands of them that are unique 3D assets. Meaning that they aren't the same asset or model with only a different color or a minor variation. They will be fully unique in terms of their in-game use, their 3D shape and have differing esthetics.The feast NFT is an innovative NFT that is common in drop-chance (meaning high supply) but also with a much higher demand, making it a lucrative endeavour for players to farm this NFT for free by playing adventures to make money. The high demand for this NFT is caused due to the burnable nature and potentially very lucrative effect on use/burn: promoting the user's castle to the top of the castle finder for an hour. This makes it so that they are found more easily by others and can receive more kingship votes for the highly profitable social rewards. Each of the top-3 ranked players of the last month will be crowned king for the entire duration of the coming month. This kingship status grants each king a 0.33% tax (1% for all kings combined) on NFT trades made during their kingship month. Token Mechanics The token mechanics have some unique features that are currently not built by any project. Infinity Skies has a sophisticated burn implementation on each transaction that is split into multiple allocations. One of those allocations is the claim pool, all token holders are eligible for this claim pool and the eligibility is being checked and confirmed through constant snapshotting of the blockchain, this allows them to fairly distribute rewards without the need for token holders to stake. In order to claim, token holders must go to their website and claim the tokens from the DApp. Additionally, they are implementing NFT Staking on Polygon where users can stake their NFTs. Infinity Exchange Infinity Skies will be developing their own NFT Marketplace that will serve as thé marketplace for games that build on the Blockchain. Their marketplace will have multiple features and functionalities that are listed here that will be released before token launch: Trading NFTsSummoning/Minting Random NFTs by burning Summoning Crystal NFTsCrafting SystemSkyblocks Claim PoolNFT Staking System Astral SpecificNFT Liquidity FarmingSkyBlocks Liquidity FarmingAuction FunctionalitSkyPlots PageWhitelabel integrations for their published games or partnersAggregator on the DreamFuel Games marketplace of all the marketplaces combined from the whitelabel(Optional possibly before/after token launch) AMM DEX for NFT's and Tokens More features might be included in the marketplace in the future, the building of their marketplace takes a lot of time since everything is built in-house. Infinity Skies does not fork or copy any contract code from existing platforms since they are creating this marketplace to serve the gaming industry and gamified Blockchain NFT industry. WHAT IS THE ROADMAP OF INFINITY SKIES?  INFINITY SKIES MARKETING STRATEGY To create a thriving community of loyal customers. Tactics: Social Media Marketing In order to build both developer- and end-user communities Infinity Skies will be utilizing public social networks along with branded communities. The goal is to build a community that is loyal to the product from the very beginning. They will accomplish this by updating their communities on every step of the process. Including telegram, discord, twitter, twitch, youtube, facebook and reddit page. Allowing for their customers to see the entire process will create brand loyalty. They will be engaging daily on their social channels to create consistency. Their team will also be utilizing networking events, influential users, articles, and blogs to create brand awareness. They are currently in the Awareness stage, using strategies such as content marketing, and public relations efforts to create recognition of their brand. Metrics: Currently the most important metrics are Engagement Metrics, along with metrics for their new website.

Add DAO token to your portfolio to have a chance at allocations in the ISKY token IDO. INFINITY SKIES REVENUE STREAMS DreamFuel Games B.V. will be generating revenue from the Infinity Skies product through the following three mechanisms: NFT RoyaltiesToken burnLicensingMarketplace/Publishing. NFT Royalties: the NFT royalty system will consist of a 10% gas price on all NFT transactions made on the Infinity Skies marketplace. 9% will be counted as revenue for DreamFuel Games and 1% will be distributed back to the top-ranking players as a 1-month long gas price reward.Token burn: The token burn is a 5% burn that can be broken down into 3 categories. 3% for play-to-earn, 1.5% for the claim-pool and 0.5% developer revenue. DreamFuel Games is planning to sell licenses for blockchain game development architectures and libraries to other start-up's and studio's as their software library grows, this will be done through proxies to make sure the software developed by DreamFuel Games B.V. remains proprietary. In the long-term DreamFuel Games is looking to expand into DreamFuel Entertainment which will be an umbrella company that also intends to take on the role of a blockchain gaming publisher and provide a standardized blockchain gaming marketplace for other games to utilize.  INFINITY SKIES TOKEN ECONOMY A Skyblock is a ERC-20 token, which is the primary currency used in and around the Infinity Skies ecosystem with numerous use-cases. Swapping Skyblocks can be swapped for other established cryptocurrencies on a decentralized exchange platform. For now, this will be Quickswap. Liquidity will be locked at a rate of 10% of the raised funds from their public presale unless a large listing event occurs elsewhere. Trading Skyblocks can be traded with other players for NFTs on the website marketplace and can be traded in other Exchanges. Skyblocks is the main currency on the Infinity Skies marketplace. Recycle Feature Skyblocks will have a recycle feature of 5% on each transaction. None of the Skyblocks will be burned forever through automated mechanics, but they are recycled to their community. The distribution of the recycle feature will be as follows: 3% distributed to Play-to-Earn stash.1.5% distributed to Claim Pool.0.5% distributed to the Development Team Play-to-Earn The largest portion from the recycle feature will be deposited into the Play-to-Earn stash. This stash is emptied each week by distributing it to active players that are playing Infinity Skies. Once emptied, the stash builds up again until the next week when it is emptied again. Each week players must complete certain tasks to be eligible for this weekly airdrop. Claim Pool The Claim Pool will be accessible for each eligible investor to claim their share of Skyblocks from the tax. Skyblock token holders can claim their share at any moment on their website and will be available to be claimed at any moment if they hold Skyblocks in their private wallet. The amount received from the pool is based on their share from the Skyblocks supply. Liquidity Providers Skyblocks Liquidity Providers stake LP tokens on Infinity Skies website and earn Quicksilver Fragments in exchange. These fragments are tradeable, uncapped utility tokens and can be used to fuse (mint) Silver Crystals with. "	19040	0.0011554621848739496	0.0003676470588235294	0.0004201680672268908

MetaGaming Guild (MGG) is one of the world's fastest growing GameFi guilds who's on a mission to make game finance fairer for the masses. MGG buys the best game assets or Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) from gaming startups and rents them out to a community of players through the scholarship program. With this, MGG scholars can access games without upfront costs, access early stage game tokens like VCs, and set their NFTs to automated yield. MGG has the support of renowned launchpads that helped to launch made live games with the highest opportunities such as DAO Maker, GameFi, Red Kite, Gamestarter and more. This creates a privileged opportunities for the MetaGaming Guild to access the best game assets in the industry. MGG coin stakers get exclusive access to the game tokens and game assets - NFTs through GameFi Vaults - the first form of game yields farming for blockchain games. MGG is a project that is driven to change and reinvent NFT blockchain gaming unlike any other! It is developed by the collective minds of the people who believe that the future of gaming will be a play-to-earn model powered by NFTs and blockchain technology. WHAT MAKES METAGAMING GUILD UNIQUE? There are many gaming communities that are popping out all over the globe but MGG is driven to surpass more so, revolutionize NFT gaming that the world has never seen. MGG always has more to offer! It takes inspiration from all those gaming startups that went live before them and integrate bits and pieces of the industry's best practices to develop a gaming guild that is unlike any other. Here is an industry comparison of MetaGaming Guild (MGG) and Yield Guild Games (YGG):  HOW DOES METAGAMING GUILD WORK? Scholarship Program MGG rents out NFT assets to players worldwide to generate revenues. This way, gamers can access NFT games without upfront costs, access and buy early-stage game tokens like VCs, and set their NFTs to automated yield. GameFi Vaults MGG acquires virtual game assets issued by start-up NFT gaming projects in VC funding and put into gamers vaults where MGG holders can earn through staking. GameYield Farming MGG offers the first DeFi protocol to lend NFT game assets to its scholars – the first form of automated NFT yield. Community DAO MGG fosters a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where members get the oppotunities to vote on the direction of the MGG network.  WHAT IS THE ROADMAP OF METAGAMING GUILD? The project was launched in the 3rd quarter of 2021 and since then, MGG was unstoppable in reinventing the NFT gaming blockchain with its forward-looking and innovative GameFi solutions. See below for the projected roadmap of MGG:  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES METAGAMING GUILD USE? Ethereum BlockchainBinance Smart Chain BlockchainSolidityUnityChainSafe Gaming SDKReact.jsWeb3.jsReact Native for iOS and AndroidAWSInfuraCloudflare GameFi Vault MetaGaming Guild is innovating the operation of yield guilds. Rather than distributing just SLP and other play-to-earn assets, MGG gives the DAO the opportunity to vote on purchase of early stage, unlisted GameFi tokens and NFTs. One of the most unique features of MGG is the GameFi Vault where we acquire virtual game assets issued by start-up NFT gaming projects in VC funding and put them into the vault. This allows MGG holders to passively earn through staking. To date, MGG has now acquired 10 early stage game assets with incredibly exciting games such as Demole, Nitro League, KingdomX, 12 Legions, Souni, Axie Infinity, Gold Fever, Dark Frontiers, PlaceWar, The Killbox, and more that are yet to be announced. These assets will be deployed to enable the DAO's player base to participate in play-to-earn economies, and ultimately benefit the player base. MGG Lending Protocol To support further the growth and sustainability of the project over time, MGG will implement a decentralized lending protocol where users can supply their idle assets in the MGG vault and generate returns based on the economic and trading activities of MGG coin. Supplied assets in the vault will then be utilized by MGG on its various business activities to generate more earnings. Users who participate in the lending protocol will be given equivalent tokens for their deposits and can generate earnings over a specific period of time. METAGAMING GUILD MARKETING STRATEGY MGG puts a high stronghold on digital marketing, social media marketing and content creation to effectively create awareness, build up its reputation and foster trust from the global crypto market. MGG has a very strong online presence, thanks to their solid digital marketing tactics. Since the project was launched in September 2021, MGG has now reached over 42,000 members on Telegram, 40,000 live followers on Twitter, 23,000 members on Discord and so on. The gaming market can expect MGG to only grow bigger over months! MGG has also been very active in attending Ask Me Anything Sessions (AMAs) across the globe, collaborating with KOLs and creating timely and highly engaging content through their Medium publication. Added to that, is the global reach of their carefully selected strategic alliances in the industry. A combination of these powerful marketing tactics allows MGG to fuel its rapid success as the fastest-growing gaming community. The token IDO for Meta Gaming Guild (MGG) is set to happen on the DAO Maker launchpad before listing on exchanges. Add DAO token to your portfolio to have a chance at allocations in the MGG token IDO. METAGAMING GUILD TOKEN ECONOMY $MGG is an ERC20 and BEP20 utility token that fuels the overall MGG ecosystem. Anyone who holds MGG coins is considered a valuable MGG stakeholder and has power to shape the various future opportunities of the project.

You can think of them like the pixelated version of Diablo or Path of Exile. MetaGods will be the first real-time bullet-hell game where your reaction time and control skills will determine your fate. The main focus of MetaGods is the game, the blockchain factor acts like icing on the cake. By creating Social GameFi, they are encouraging people to play together. Simply put: the more people join a lobby and squad up, the higher the overall APY. It's time to take metaverse gaming to the next level. MetaGods is providing true utility to NFTs. These generative NFTs are not only your profile picture, but act as your IN GAME characters as well. For the first time, you can upgrade and level up the randomly generated character for stronger attack power, or defense etc. Each character's tier is dependent on their godility. This is also known as their god blood. For example, if you have a god and a mortal in the family tree, the result is a demigod. If your ancestors are all gods, then you have a titan. The godility will also determine your character stats. All equipment and items are in fact NFTs. This includes armor, weapons, and other items. The $MGOD token will have utility through the purchase of limited edition adventure packs - more on this in the token section. There are also two game modes available, casual and hardcore. In casual mode, the game is on autoplay, and your character will automatically fight mob enemies to earn XP points and the in-game token, $RELIC. In hardcore mode, you will have full control over your character. It is in this mode that the APY is the highest. All of the rare loot and dungeon items are better here. HOWEVER, be warned! If you die here, you will encounter NFT permadeath - your character will be locked out of this mode for the rest of the season. Casual mode will still be available if you die in hardcore mode. WHAT MAKES METAGODS UNIQUE? In traditional gaming, you have great game mechanics, but no play-to-earn blockchain mechanics. In blockchain gaming, most games are RPG's. Many games allow you to earn, but may not necessarily be fun. MetaGods is built on the principle of high demand for a fun game that is also financially incentivized. This, and 8-bit has always been super hot in crypto. Just one look at cryptopunks and you can see that this retro style is iconic for our industry! There is another thing that sets us apart from the rest. We are an ACTION RPG. What's the difference between an ACTION RPG and a regular RPG you may ask? The biggest difference between an ACTION RPG and a regular RPG is the timing. In regular RPG's, you usually have turn-based activities. For example, player 1 flips a card and attacks. Player 2 then flips his/her card, and retaliates. It's a bit too slow for us, so we decided to create a game in real-time. With a real-time action RPG, you are IN THE ACTION. This means that everything is happening right now. This moment, you must react. The onslaught of bullets fired upon you must be evaded NOW. Your reaction time, your full control of the character.. all those real skills must be put to use if you want to survive. This is an advantage for us because there are not too many Action RPG's built on the blockchain. We chose 8-bit not only for the retro style, but because we know that we can make something quickly and deploy it fast.  They are also implementing a Social GameFi element into the game. There is a bit of a strategy here. Much like many other MMORPGs, you must team up with a squad of different roles in order to defeat the strongest bosses and receive the highest APY. You should always have a healer on the team. You should always have a tank on the team, and a healer that can heal everyone in the party. The ""holy trinity"" of MMO still exists here, and we have imported it over from the traditional gaming world. We've also been working on a chat function:  When you type a message, it will pop up over the character head. As you walk around, people in the game can also see your message. It will also appear as green text as a blast to the entire lobby or party that you are currently in. WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF METAGODS? The first feature would be Generative NFTs. NFTs are no longer just a PFP, they are your IN GAME character as well. This means that the generated NFT that you mint will be able to be used in the dungeons. As you fight different bosses and climb the leaderboard, you will be able to see your name and NFT posted for the world to see. Second, MetaGods features social GameFi. This is a new phenomenon in the blockchain space, but not in the traditional gaming world. They have incentivized a play-to-earn model that rewards playing in large groups. The MORE people you play together with, the HIGHER the APY. Third, the game is a REAL TIME action RPG. This means that you must use your reaction time and control skills to defeat mythical monsters and survive. Unlike most turn-based RPGs, this one is different. You're in the heat of the action, and it's up to you to win the APY rewards. Fourth, MetaGods features NFT permadeath. In hardcore mode, you must risk everything to acquire the rarest rewards. If you die, however, be prepared to lose everything. Some may argue that this is not a good feature, but it puts RISK in the game. Who wants to play a game that you can never lose? The game is supposed to be fun. This includes the risk of LOSS, driving competition even further. Another feature is the in-game economy. All equipment (weapons, armor, items, consumables) are NFTs. Trade these in the marketplace and among friends and gamers. MetaGods has multiple game modes, which are fit for everyone. They have casual mode, which is autoplay and stake-to-earn. The game will run on its own, and you can leave it to earn passively. Hardcore mode is the one where you have full control, but risk it all. And finally, they will host special tournaments and events. They are working on discord features that will allow one-click play. You send an invite to your friend, and they click the link.. and BOOM. They're in your lobby ready to play. MetaGods is making it easy for everyone. METAGODS ROADMAP  METAGODS REVENUE STREAMS  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES METAGODS USE? The team has previously created the dungeon crawling engine, and is building out the DeFi stack and game design simultaneously. As you know, testing is vital in the blockchain world, because when you add a financial layer on top, you cannot make mistakes. The game is built on Unity, and the blockchain of choice is Binance Smart Chain. They have plans to eventually port to other chains, such as Solana. However, this will not happen until later down the line. METAGODS MARKETING STRATEGY MetaGods will acquire users by putting out a real product. They have already sold over 15,000 character NFTs that were designed in Unity, with more counting by the minute. This massive support from the community encourages the game engineers to build quickly. The best way to acquire users is by having a quality game. DeFi Development: We are building the DeFi financial layer in unison with the game development side. By building both in parallel, we are capable of setting up wireframes to prepare for integration. There is a lot of testing that needs to be done. As you know, with a financial layer and smart contracts involved, you must constantly be testing. This is the only way to avoid mistakes. We are pushing hard to have an early sneak peek for everyone for the holidays, so please stay tuned! Game Development: We also have my different things planned to get the community hype. First, we will have item drops and ""attributes of the week"" in the upcoming future. By this we mean with three possible giveaways, which include armor, weapons, and items. More info below:  Zeus' lightning bolts They are a projectile weapon that fires out from the character. Heavy damage lightning bolts with a high rate of fire. When equipped, you will rain havoc on the enemy. This is a legendary weapon that can only be found in certain dungeons, or as a special airdrop to the community. Zeus' Armor This is legendary loot that is found in several levels throughout the game. It offers high defense and protection from mob onslaughts and special bosses. Another special attribute of this suit of armor is its resistance to lightning attacks. When fighting Zeus or other lightning-based bosses, this will come in handy. Resurrection Stone This stone, when equipped, will allow you to come back to life. In hardcore mode, NFT permadeath is prevalent. This means that when you lose all your life, your character will be locked out of hardcore mode for the remainder of the season. The only way back is with this equipped. HOWEVER, beware that this also takes up one of your item slots. There's only 4. 1 for armor, 1 for weapons, and 2 for items. If you equip this item you will only have room for ONE more item. As game developers, game balancing is one of our main priorities.  Here's a sample UI. Note the 4 item slots underneath the map. Character Attributes and Stats When characters are generated, we also will provide the rarity of the character. Each character will then have 6 base abilities that will be rolled. They are: StrengthDexterityCharismaIntelligenceWisdomConstitution Based on these attributes and your character class/rarity, it will yield your character stats.  Stats include your character's Health Points (HP), Mana Points (MP), Attack Power, and Defense Power. Since the characters are randomly generated NFTs, they can consist of different gods and rarities (body parts). Here's a few of the full gods for your reference. They are of varying rarity.   They are also implementing a leaderboard, so that the top players can have their name and NFT characters displayed for the world to see.  Last but not least, they are planning to have an APE BOSS. They love apes, and they are in crypto… so we've created a boss fight that will be fun. Introducing… Balor Ape.  He's got 4 basic animations. Weapons locked, Weapons free, and both striking positions. He is forged of fire and lightning, so Zeus' armor would offer good relief in this battle. On top of the drops mentioned earlier, we will also have tournaments (utilizing the leaderboard) for players to fight against each other, as well as dungeon environments. There will also be boss challenge events, similar to the boss ape. Players will have a limited time to enter these special dungeons, where the APY and rewards are the highest. If you are not well equipped for these battles, you will lose everything. The bosses all have special attacks and an incredible amount of HP. These special boss challenges will get more and more difficult as the time goes by, and we will have over 50 of them. We are currently in development on these as well. With heavy gaming development, we plan to go to market with a real game that the world can play. We're bringing blockchain gaming to the next level, and it would be an honor to have your support. METAGODS TOKEN ECONOMY $MGOD Token - The MGOD token will be the core game token, designed to be deflationary by nature. It will be used to purchase unique and limited edition adventure packs, which consist of character NFTs and equipment. Using the MGOD token to purchase allows players to strive for mythical character strength and god-tier character NFTs. On top of this, players will receive mythical and legendary items to use in-game. The only way to defeat stronger bosses in the highest yield dungeons is by equipping the strongest weapons and armor. Thus, whoever uses the MGOD token will have a better edge in-game. The MGOD token will also be used as an entry fee, to get into special dungeons for the rarest rewards and highest APY. Another use case will be for the governance of game direction. They have many dungeons and levels in development, but it is up to the community which realm they release first. Supporters will stake the MGOD token to earn the in-game token. The in-game token, $RELIC will be the backbone of the largest metaverse economy. RELIC tokens are used to enter dungeons (entry fee), as well as used to purchase, repair, and upgrade weapons and armours. In game consumable items can also be purchased by the RELIC token. When players stake the MGOD token, they will slowly earn XP and the RELIC token. They will then use this token in the game as a utility for fast track character upgrades, item buying and entrance fees.   "	12573	0.0014316392269148174	7.953551260637875e-05	0.0001590710252127575

WAM is a play-to-earn crypto-gaming platform where everybody can play & compete with friends in simple hyper-casual tournaments to access crypto rewards. The platform can be accessed on any mobile web browser or downloaded from Google Play and the AppStore. On the WAM.app site, the more a player wins the more their in-platform rank grows, just like normal real-life leaderboards in competitive sports. Once a player advances their rank they can participate in more rewarding tournaments with higher entrance fees & reward pools. Each tournament has a reward pool where WAM.app adds a fixed amount of $WAM token for every player who buys the entrance fee. At the end of the tournament the rewards are distributed algorithmically to a percentage of the top players based on the statistics like players’ score and ranking. They got the inspiration from real life amateur sports tournaments where millions of people from all over the world compete in games like: football, basketball, rugby, tennis, billiards, darts and many more, just to have fun and spend time together with friends and family. The pandemic showed them the importance of sharing experiences and keeping in touch with our peers and doing it on a digital platform with people from all over the globe is the simplest way to do it. On WAM.app players can: Participate in tournaments to win rewards in $WAMBe the OWNER of one or many games from the platform (as NFTs)Trade NFTs won in specific tournaments on the marketplaceBuild their player profile by winning tournamentsGrow an audience of fans to engage with them through custom tournamentsCreate their own games with AI assisted technology using their phones WHAT MAKES WAM UNIQUE? WAM.app is the first hyper-casual gaming platform using blockchain tech. Competitors: Softgames: Focused on Facebook Instant Games with tournaments. The many difference start with the platform (Facebook vs web + app on WAM.app) and the business model (ads vs crypto rewards) . Gamee: Spun out of their Telegram bot, Arc 8 wants to be a platform very similar to WAM.app where people compete for coins (their coin flopped since launch - the main reason being the delayed launch since the app was not ready). Grid: Game creation tool (similar to what they're building for the community). Traditional companies have a focus on educational and small style advergames. Womplay: Focused on the Russian market (according to similar web) they offer games with tournaments but have a more diluted offering (you can play more game types).  WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF WAM? WAM is a play-to-earn hyper-casual gaming platform focused on quick tournaments where users pay an entrance fee and compete to rank higher on the leaderboard until the tournament ends. WAM is a social gaming platform as each player has their own user profile where other people can see statistics about that player based on such information as his wins, $WAM won and rank. The UI is Tiktok style and is comprised of 5 walls: Amateur - tournaments with the lowest entry fee ( apro $5 in $WAM )Semi-pro - once the player surpasses 5k in won $WAM, he is able to access these tournamentsPro - tournaments one can enter after reaching $250k in won $WAMLegend - tournaments accessible to those who reached $1M in $WAM winningsPrivate - the tournaments the user makes to invite friends To enter a tournament, players have to pay an entry fee (in $WAM) that goes into a smart contract which is automatically generated by a smart contract generator. Each tournament lasts a variable number of days and $WAM will be locked until the tournament ends. When the tournament does end, the backend informs the smart contract of the winners and the reward pool is re-distributed to them. WAM is looking to be a simple platform that can be used by the masses to win crypto rewards. As 1.5B people around the world already consider themselves casual games players, it's easy to see how their product can really help the crypto adoption. WAM ROADMAP They started building the version of the app you can see now live on WAM.app almost 2 years ago. It took almost one year in development until they launched the beta version of the web app this year in February. After 4 months they released the mobile apps as well. But over the summer, they had loads of messages from the users where they were asking ""How can I earn? How can I withdraw? How can I make money?"". Seeing the play-to-earn field evolving and also listening to the users feedback they decided this September that they have to migrate the platform to crypto.  WAM REVENUE STREAMS Tournament fees: 10% from each tournament reward poolIn-game revivals: To continue from the same score, a player can choose to pay for a revivalNFTs: Initial sales of NFTs (games, avatars, ingame items) & a royalty fee for each recurring transactionMarketplace: All transactions on the marketplace will have a 3% fee  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES WAM USE? They have a wide range of technologies used for the platform – Node.js, Golang, Laravel, Vue.js are just the main ones. Also they are using Solidity for blockchain development. The main focus until now was to go more on the consumer side than on the technology, and to create a platform that people will love. Thus so far they did not build any technologies from scratch. But they plan to develop it own game builder tool, which will use OpenAI Codex in order to make it easy for everyone to create their own hyper-casual game, just by giving simple instructions and with minimum UI interaction. WAM has integrated the ERC-20 token standard for WAM Coin into the WAM.app stack, and also ERC-1155 / ERC-721 non-fungible token standards (NFTs) for the digital assets storage and trading. WAM MARKETING STRATEGY Launched in February 2021 as public beta WAM reached more than 2.5M players in less than 2 months with tournaments reaching as many as 10k players and +3.5M players in total until Nov 2021. After this initial success they decided to create the mobile apps where to this date they have been downloaded more than 180K times so far. They currently have 313k registered accounts, and 1.5 hour average engagement time in the last 30 days. Going forward, the marketing strategy consists of a mix between their own affiliate marketing program where they partner up with premium publishers, influencers and gaming communities while also growing the internal media buying team. The token IDO for WAM ($WAM) is set to happen on the DAO Maker launchpad before listing on exchanges. Add DAO token to your portfolio to have a chance at allocations in the WAM token IDO.   WAM TOKEN ECONOMY The token has a few different utilities: 1. Play-To-Earn: In order to join the tournaments on WAM.app you'll need to have $WAM; You join the tournaments, make a great score (skill based) and win a good position in the leaderboard in order to receive a % of the tournament reward pool; this is the main utility cause any player who wants to join WAM.app need to have $WAM (current WAM price could be checked on website); 2. Own-To-Earn: They plan to allow people to OWN games on the platform. The games will be owned as NFTs and you can earn $WAM from the tournaments created on that game. They see a lot of potential in this regarding the token utility, cause in order to have a chance to own a game on our platform you will need to lock and hold $WAM. 3. Market-To-Earn: Marketers can rent a game from an Owner and promote or create tournaments on it. This way they will earn revenue from the users they bring on these tournaments. 4. Develop-To-Earn: They'll have a third party developer program where people who own $WAM can invest in the games that developers plan to build. These games will be then published on WAM.app and those who invested in the game will get a % from the reward pools of the tournaments created with the game. This is also connected with (2) because the developers will also be the first owners of the NFTs created for their games. 5. Staking & Liquidity Mining: Provide $WAM liquidity to earn APY. they'll also have NFT passes for some special tournaments where the reward pool is guaranteed by the platform. These NFTs can be earned as a reward for staking. "	8216	0.0010954235637779942	0.00036514118792599804	0.0007302823758519961

Contents can range from static 3D objects to interactive systems such as games. LAND is a non-fungible, transferrable, scarce digital asset stored in a Solana smart contract. It can be acquired by spending an SPL token called Solice ($SLC). $SLC coin can also be used to make in-world purchases of digital goods and services. In Solice crypto metaverse, players will be able to buy and collect various pets, gemstones and other collectibles as NFTs. Aside from collectibles users will be also able to create their own assets, mini-games and build on top of their own land plots. By actively participating and building in the metaverse, users are able to collect in-game coins or SLC tokens and other rare assets as rewards for completing quests with success, clearing dungeons, and reaching leaderboards.  WHAT MAKES SOLICE UNIQUE? Solice ID: Solice ID is what you'll use to get access to your metaverse portfolio. Users will be able to connect their wallets to their Solice ID for identification, without giving out any unnecessary information.Editor: The editor program is a stand-alone SDK that enables users to create their own assets and mini-games, provided it meets requirements. Users then turn these assets into virtual tokens (NFTs) for digital scarcity, security, and authenticity. These can be displayed/played within the Solice crypto metaverse circulating in its economy.User-Designed Revenue Model: Solice allows users to opt into revenue generation, with revenue models they can design themselves. A simple revenue model would be to charge an entrance fee for access to a piece of land or a building. For example, places like an art gallery, arcade, live concert, and personal NFT collection hall could all be successfully monetized with this model.Item Crafting System: Users can obtain ingredients and materials within the metaverse. Those ingredients and materials can then be crafted into complete NFT assets, which change the asset’s rarity and scarcity.Play-to-Earn: In a later stage, we'll be introducing a Play-to-Earn mechanism into the metaverse. We're working on dungeons, mini-games, and quests that reward users.DeFi Components: The Solice metaverse draws on innovative DeFi protocols to offer exciting features. For example, we added a utility to the land plots so users can perform Land Staking, allowing users to stake tokens on their land plots to obtain extra APY rewards while offering chances of obtaining rare materials and ingredients at the same time.Pet System: There'll be plenty of pets in the Solice metaverse, all with different attributes and a varying rarity level. Those elements will inform various APY rates, giving users a stronger chance of obtaining rare items, like gemstones — or Eggs, which can be hatched into new pets!Marketplace: The Marketplace is not just a web-based exchange center. Unique to other projects, we will be launching the Marketplace within the Solice metaverse, where users will be able to see objects in 3D VR, giving potential buyers a more immersive, customer-centric experience. We're only just seeing the first steps of metaverse adoption, and Solice is committed to driving it forward, offering immersive blockchain-powered experiences and innovative cross-technology features of the best crypto practices.  HOW DOES SOLICE WORK? The Solice metaverse consists of a decentralized ledger for ownership within the virtual world, this could be a piece of land or any other assets such as clothing apparel, and pets. All involve a protocol for describing the content of each land parcel or asset and a peer-to-peer network for user interactions. Avatar An Avatar is a virtual character that represents the user within the Solice metaverse, each Avatar comes in pre-made appearance and animation sets, but may be changed and modified by the user itself later. The Avatar will also be modifiable piece by piece (hat, arms, torso, legs, etc.) by equipping it with different compatible assets tokens. This enables users to create their own unique Avatar to distinguish themselves from other users within the Solice crypto space. Asset & LAND Assets & LAND are blockchain-based virtual tokens (Using Solana blockchain) representing physical parcels and objects of the Solice metaverse. It allows users to own a part of the metaverse and thus be able to host content (examples are toll fees, mini-games, and tickets). The Solice Metaverse is based on a map of fixed amounts of LAND place (scarce). LANDS are physical spaces in the Metaverse owned by players to create and monetize any type of activity (free or paid). Every piece of LAND comes with a set of prebuilt terrains, but it can be transformed and modified by the user who owns it (or other users they invite to work on it). Users are able to purchase LANDS, each LAND parcel is 15 meters by 15 meters in size and represented by an NFT. LAND can be purchased with the Solice token ($SLC), the total number of LAND parcels in Solice is capped at 60.000. However, the common spaces, arenas, and roads are owned by the developers of Solice and cannot be bought or sold by users. LAND Staking: LAND owners are able to stake their SLC tokens on the LANDS that they own to earn rewards, and to have a chance to obtain rare materials/ingredients. Those materials/ingredients can be used to create rare scarce assets or to enhance the current rarity ranking of an existing asset. The rare materials/ingredients can also be traded on the marketplace. In the future, users will be able to combine LANDS together to form CITIES. In the future, CITIES will have the potential to be owned by multiple users to form DISTRICTS. Pet Pets are blockchain-based virtual tokens (Using Solana blockchain) representing physical pets in the Solice metaverse. Pets will remain visible on the land plot (for LAND owners) but they can also follow their owners around when moving in the metaverse. There'll be plenty of pets in the Solice metaverse, pets will follow the users around in All pets come with different attributes and a varying rarity level. Those elements will inform various APY rates, giving users a stronger chance of obtaining rare items, like gemstones - or Eggs, which can be hatched into new pets New pets that are being hatched from the eggs may have different rarities. Eggs can also be directly traded on the marketplace. Quest There is a proportion of the tokens reserved for user incentives. By successfully completing quests in the metaverse, players could earn SLC tokens, rare assets and upgrade their items. This design is to encourage user participation volume in the game and to maintain traction. Dungeon Within the Solice Metaverse, there are appearances of Gates. Gates are magical portals that are spawning at uncertain time intervals and connect the Solice metaverse to the void dungeons. Users will be able to interact with the gates and enter the void dungeons as an adventure. Within the void dungeons, there will be a variety of challenges and games. By clearing the dungeon, users will obtain $SLC tokens and/or rare assets as a reward. Gates usually last for five to seven days. Crafting System Users can obtain ingredients and materials within the metaverse. Those ingredients and materials can then be crafted into complete NFT assets, which causes the asset to increase in rarity and scarcity. Marketplace The Marketplace is a web-based exchange center, however unique to some other projects, we will also be launching the Marketplace within the Solice metaverse, where users will be able to see objects in 3D VR, giving potential buyers a more immersive, customer-centric experience. Anything and everything that can be sold will be sold in our open marketplace. This includes: Land plotsPetsSpecial avatarsBuildingsPet eggsGemstonesRaw materialsCrafted items Editor Solice offers a convenient way to create, assemble, share 3D model assets and build mini-games. We encourage and empower individual creators with intuition and the freedom to create anything. You can make your own 3D assets, animate them, and publish/sell them in our worldwide marketplace. The editor program is a stand-alone SDK that enables users to create their own assets and mini-games, provided it meets requirements. Users then turn these assets into virtual tokens (NFTs) for digital scarcity, security, and authenticity. These can be displayed/played within the Solice metaverse. User Designed Revenue Models Solice allows users to opt into revenue generation, with revenue models they can design themselves. A simple revenue model would be to charge an entrance fee for access to a piece of LAND or a building. For example, an art gallery, arcade, live concert, and personal NFT collection hall could all be monetized with this model. Note that the revenue models are optional but not mandatory, LAND and building owners can also make the area free and accessible for everyone that simply wants to enjoy the game. WHAT IS THE ROADMAP OF SOLICE?  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES SOLICE USE?

Players could collect heroes, complete tasks, challenge activities, participate in the war, and establish the personal game kingdom through social networking and territory development. The overall ecology in the game is based on the GameFi Protocol. It enhances the fun of the game, ensures the game assets, and enables all players to benefit from the game and win tokens or rewards. KINGDOMX MARKETING STRATEGY Overview Due to the outstanding performance of KingdomX, more and more communities chose to support KingdomX. They are Avocado Guild, Unix Gaming, MetaGaming Guild, Good Game Guild, MAO DAO, and SnapFingers Dao. Regular updates: KingdomX hold campaigns regularly every one to two weeks, and also post tweets, operate telegram groups every day to do interaction with players Media exposure: We already have official accounts on Twitter, Medium, also own official groups on Telegram and Discord. What's more, KingdomX already has cooperation relationships with many international marketing companies, and these companies already published much news related to KingdomX regularly. KOL support: KingdomX already collaborates with hundreds of KOLs from all over the world. They all have popular accounts on many kinds of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter. WHAT MAKES KINGDOMX UNIQUE? Nowadays, there are a lot of blockchain games on the market, most of them are designed based on NFT, but few games are solving the inflation and devaluation problem of NFT. It will be an issue for NFT holders. KingdomX will not only be a high-quality game on the market, but also provide a fun game mechanism to burn and generate NFTs. Players can get profit through this process, and all the logic is running on blockchain by the KingsLanding Protocol. It is designed to avoid inflation and solve the liquidity issues for NFTs. KINGDOMX PRODUCT ROADMAP  KINGDOMX REVENUE STREAMS  HOW DOES KINGDOMX WORK? Variety Game Experience: There will be different game modes for players. KingsLanding Protocol: The protocol is used to generate and buy back NFT. It is designed to avoid inflation and solve the liquidity issues for NFTs. Play to Earn: According to KingdomX adventure and war gameplays, players can earn KNT and KT. Logic on Blockchain: The gameplay logic is based on smart contracts. Which can create trust in a trustless ecosystem. Multiple Coins: There are two types of tokens, governance token and game token. Governance token gives holders more rights. Game token provides a better game experience. KINGDOMX TECHNOLOGIES The KingsLanding Protocol, used to generate and destroy NFT, was originally proposed by KingdomX for this project. Hero NFT uses a unique modular splicing technology, which uses a limited number of graphic elements to combine a large number of non-repetitive NFT appearances, which can almost make every NFT look different. The team is currently studying threshold signatures, which may be used in this project in the future to reduce the difficulty for users to enter blockchain games and also improve security. KINGDOMX TOKEN ECONOMY King Token Token Generation King Token (KT) is the core Token in KingdomX for value transmissions and community governance. In the game, KT is mainly used as ""bottoming"" to recruit heroes. In the game, players gain KT after they participate in wars and get rewards from their rankings. Lock Up To prevent inflation caused by the circulation of Token, all KT holders are encouraged to lock up their KT with the following measures to ensure the benefits and revenues of long-time KT holders and players who lock up their KT. Deposit KT for recruiting new heroes — A certain amount of KT is needed to recruit new heroes. 80 percent of KT used as ""bottoming"" is deposited in Kingslanding Protocol. When the recruited hero is sent to war, there will be low possibilities of battle damage. Also, if battle damage happens, the deposited KT will be fully returned to the player.Deposit KT for a quicker recovery — Players can deposit KT for a quicker recovery in the game. In other words, depositing KT increases the amount of daily available Energy. Players can win more rewards, such as KNT, Exp, Reputation, by participating in adventures and wars, which consume Energy.Staking mining for upgrading equipment parts — When equipment parts need to arrive key level, both KT and KNT need to be used for completing upgrading. when upgrading successfully, used KT and KNT will be locked up. If heroes trigger battle damage, all KT which is locked up for upgrading will be returned as for rate. Burning Every year, there will be natural inflation of KT due to the issue of KT sold in the fundraising period and other presold KT, and the KT generated regularly after wars in the game. To control inflation, there is a certain Token destroying mechanism called Burning. The percentage of Burned KT is under the control of the KingsLanding Protocol, and the speed of Burning is decided by KT holders who are in the DAO vote. Methods are as follows: Recruit new heroes — A certain percentage of KT used as ""bottoming"" in recruiting new heroes will be Burned, and this percentage is decided by KT holders who are in the DAO vote.Buy Campaign tickets — Users can use KT to buy tickets for special campaigns. For example, after using KT to buy tickets to challenge the world boss, you will be eligible to compete for high-quality NFT. More personalized special campaigns will be launched later, and all KT spent on special events will be burned.When equipment parts are upgraded, KT is required to upgrade some key levels. As the level of equipment parts increases, the success rate of the upgrade gradually decreases. If the upgrade fails, the KT used in the upgrade will be burned."	5821	0.0022332932485827177	0.0003435835767050335	0.0003435835767050335

With DeFi infrastructure rapidly growing, aggregators in high demand, cross-chain transactions being the future, 1Sol is born to bring together liquidity from both DeFi and CeFi (swaps, orderbook DEX(s), OTC, etc.) for multi-chains. WHAT MAKES 1SOL UNIQUE? 1inch 1Sol is native on Solana. Language, logic are different for Solana Rust and it takes time to integrate with each swap since it's not just a language translation situation. Dagg They started the same time as 1SOL, but they have stopped due to lack of devs. Atlas They are not actually building a DEX aggregator. It's more of a front-end work plus Serum. Besides DEX Aggregation, Crypto Community Boost and Project Promotion are part of the services 1Sol proposes. Not Just a DEX (decentralized crypto exchange) Aggregator  1Sol Aims To Aggregate Everything, adding more value to the end user. What is planned to be aggregated in the future:  Swaps, overbooks, CeFi markets, OTC marketsNFT trading aggregationGameFi lootbox and accessories trading markets1-step lending & borrowing Cross-ChainTransactions on Solana Being The Future DEX aggregators are an essential part of the decentralized economic system that give access to route liquidity from different exchanges in Defi and CeFi. An aggregator is like a search engine for crypto traders. It can automatically optimize swaps between different networks at a lower cost than single-chain decentralized exchanges. HOW DOES 1SOL WORK? A cross-chain DEX aggregator for decentralized protocols on Solana. The Process Of How 1Sol Works Initialize Accounts. The first step to get started is creating an account and adding gas credits.Smart Calculator. 1Sol smart calculator will do the price comparing and the work of finding the best transaction route with lower gas fees.Swap. You confirm the transaction, then we exchange it. You don’t need to care about the technical part.Return To You. Once everything’s done we transfer you back the max amount of tokens you swapped. 1Sol's Cross-Chain Transaction Model, using Solana - ETH as an example: 1. 1Sol first issues smart contracts on both chains and establishes a two-way binding of users' public key on both contracts. 2. At the same time, smart contract e-vault went live on ETH to establish a 1:1 fixed ratio one-way exchange between USDT coin and 1Sol-USDT. Every time a user deposits 1 USDT, 1Sol-USDT is issued to the user, and when the user cashes 1Sol-USDT to the contract, 1Sol-UDST is destroyed and a certain amount of USDT is exchanged according to the AMM in the pool. 3. 1Sol official first pledges a certain amount of USDT to the e-vault contract and generates an equal amount of 1Sol-USDT as the base reserve of the vault. 4. When a user uses n amount of USDT(Solana) to buy cross-chain BTC on Solana, the user initiates a transaction request to the cross-chain contract 1cross through the 1Sol contract and transfers n amount of USDT(Solana) to the 1cross contract. 5. At this point, 1Sol's centralized service - 1narwhal - detects that the 1cross contract has successfully received a sum of n amount of USDT and requests to trade wBTC on the ETH network. 1narwhal calls the ETH contract e-vault to transfer n amount of 1Sol-USDT to it and destroy it, and cashes out m>=n USDT(ETH), and uses these n amount of USDT to swap wBTC through 1Sol's dex aggregator on ETH. 6. The user claims the wBTC converted in the previous step using the ETH wallet he/she bound in the first step. WHAT IS THE ROADMAP OF 1SOL?  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES 1SOL USE?  1SOL MARKETING STRATEGY Community building: They went live on the main net for a week, with daily trading volume over 9M and rising. They have reached a community of over 200K live crypto users.Liquidity provider: 1Sol receive LP from early investors including NGC ventures, Axia8 ventures and partners such as Orca (cryptocurrency exchange) and Dexlab (decentralized exchange).Be native on Solana: 1Sol is the native DEX aggregator on Solana and will feature cross-chain in next Q.

Prometheus is the first on-chain strategy Role Playing NFT game launched on BSC. Prometheus creates themes based on the exchange, collusion, and fusion of Eastern and Western mythology. Prometheus features most major mythological systems from the East and West. Prometheus is a different gaming experience than the usual NFT game available on the market. Prometheus Fight is a 5v5 battle. It features daily arena matches, significant events, and guild battles. Players are awarded in-game currency (WP) for winning PVP or PVE. All faction god cards are NFTs and their collectable value will vary based on their rarity volume. Players can select from a variety of NFTs based on their specific requirements. WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF PROMETHEUS? God cards and battle cards are the two main card types in the game. Only a small number of battle cards will be released by the project team, and the majority of battle cards will be generated from God spirit cards. The battle cards will be divided into ten generations. The NFT card system will include a lot of features. Combat NFT's combat ability and may evolve into a more powerful advanced combat role NFT. There's a potential that a battle card will get weaker, stronger, or mutated every time it's improved and synthesized. Players can compete in PvE, PvP, daily missions, and other battles. The features of guild, land, arena, and war of gods will gradually open up in the later stages, adding to the game's performance, inventiveness, involvement, playability, and participation.

Advanced crypto airdrops are sent out by Discord. NFT is now available on Binance NFT market and is successfully reach the top three weekly sales on the platform. They are one of top creators on Bianance NFT and will also adopt ""mystery box"" sales in the future to encourage more users to participate in NFT purchases. Their IDO will launch on the DAO Maker, GameFi and Red Kite platforms. Prometheus created an ""ambassador"" strategy to recruit the individual with the most Discord contacts. More than 100 KOLs from all around the world help with content creation, promotions, product reviews, etc. Additionally, they will make and distribute promotional videos to help more people understand Prometheus and draw attention to it. The Beta Version of Prometheus will be released only to the most active users - the spots are limited. Finally, a worldwide media announcement will be made. PROMETHEUS TOKEN ECONOMY The game has a dual token system (governance and game tokens). Economic models are based on the crypto concept of ""playing to earn."" Token for the game WP: Name of in-game token: The most important data is the prize token in the game is Wish Power, which refers to the power obtained through hope and is abbreviated as WP. WP Problem Although the overall quantity of WP is limitless, the daily production is manageable. Based on the overall amount of additions in the game, the maximum number of WP adds each day will be determined. The awards earned by player PVE and PVP actions are primarily responsible for the rise in WP. PVE data activity is projected to account for 30% of overall production, whereas PVP activity is predicted to account for 70% of total output. WP Consumption The cost of WP comes from the synthesis of new battle cards, the expansion of future player guilds, the upgrade of expansion treasures, and other significant in-game actions. WP is the most crucial source of revenue for P2E, and the overall currency price will be stable. Project Governance Token MGA Project Governance Token cryptocurrency MGA is short for the name of our Game studio, MetaGame Arena. MGA cryptocurrency will serve as a platform token across multiple games in the near future, linking NFT resources within each game and creating link value. MGA provides decentralized communities with the underlying technical support for a complete project development route voting scheme. MGA can be purchased on the open market. The MGA was a necessary upgrade to combat cards in Prometheus games and was an essential production resource for every player seeking advanced combat power. MGA Data and additional Note Today, MGA crypto acts as governance token, the total number is currently 30 million, players can freely purchase MGA through the open market. PVP Ranking rewards: MGA is reward to top rank PVP battle player, this can bring great rewards and honors to top players. When the game starts running, the composition of battle cards cost is at ratio of 4:1 WP:MGA. So buying MGA is the only way to get advanced cards. MGA consumption will go into the black hole account completely, ensuring that the overall MGA in the game continues to deflate. MGA Repurchase and news The MGA held by the project team will be used for risk pre-plan treatment. When the market has short-term severe inflation or deflation, the project team will actively intervene to stabilize the market and provide a protection mechanism for the price (in USD) collapse. Liquidity Mining of MGA MGA will support LP mining in the future. For players with a low-risk appetite or do not have the ability to create volume, pledging MGA coins mining is also a good investment option. Going live soon.

This is the starting point of a new paradigm in the sports ecosystem, decentralized and of which you can actively participate in multiple ways. This universe is a combination of 3 multibillion dollar markets with global impact: video games, soccer and sports betting, all merged by blockchain and NFT technologies, another multibillion dollar market that just started to take off. MetaSoccer is also part of a new generation of video games in which the user can earn cryptocurrency for their contributions to the ecosystem. These games are known as ""Play to Earn"" and have recently been popularized by the success of Axie Infinity. The MetaSoccer universe is designed with the community at its core; therefore they have created the $MSU token, with which holders will be able to participate in key votes for the future of MetaSoccer. WHAT MAKES META SOCCER UNIQUE? Thanks to blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), for the first time in the history of video games, users can own game assets. All MetaSoccer assets evolve during the course of the game. As they are used, their abilities will increase until they reach their full potential. In addition, just as in real life, the characters in the game will age in the club and retire. This mechanism is used to control the overpopulation of characters in the long term and provide the universe with more realism. Some asset types will be able to perform another role when their career in the previous role is terminated. Youth Scouts Youth Scouts are a fundamental pillar of the game; the introduction of new players to the MetaSoccer universe depends on them (known as Scouting), as a general rule, no player will be incorporated into the game without having been previously discovered by a scout. Each Youth Scout has a set of specific attributes, namely age, club and skills. These characteristics will have a direct impact in their performance in the game.  Players Players are another cornerstone of the game, as they will be one of the keys to determining the success of your club. Each player has a series of attributes, some fixed, and some variables in the short or long term: Role: the natural position that the player occupies on the field;Age: may vary between 16-19 (the age from which they join a team) and 38 (the age they retire);Club: in which they play, and that can change;Personal attributes: condition, morale and injuries;Skills: they define a player that define a player and are important to the player's performance on the pitch;Overall: the average of all Skills. It will be updated as the Skills evolve;Potential: the maximum quality value a player can achieve. This quality will be directly related to the number of training sessions, friendly matches and official matches, but will also depend on the player's learning value and age;Special abilities: special qualities that a player has. These can be innate or can be transmitted by the coach through training. Special skills will be decisive in match simulations, increasing the chances of successful action at a particular time.  Stadiums Stadiums are another asset in the MetaSoccer universe. Stadiums host matches played at home, providing the owner with additional profits for each match (for ticket sales). Stadiums can also be rented to other clubs, so the stadium owner will receive a % of the earnings generated by each match. META SOCCER ROADMAP  HOW DOES META SOCCER WORK? Players can participate in the MetaSoccer universe with two different roles: Owner: can establish a Club and handle the hiring/management of personnel, discovery of new players, player signings/sales, and finance management.Manager: is in charge of managing the sports area. Their responsibility is to maximize the potential of players through a proper training plan, prepare the appropriate strategy for each match, and keep players in the best shape and mood possible. Although by default one user will occupy both roles, in the future it will also be possible to share responsibility among several users. These roles will have several different activities to handle. Scouting Owners can send a Youth Scout in search of promising young players to join the team. After each Scouting, the scout will gain more experience and its attributes will improve. Sending the scout to explore costs $MSU. This cost will be higher or lower depending on the knowledge attribute of the scout. The number of players found in each scouting will also vary according to their knowledge. Mentoring With 2 Youth Scouts in a Club, there is a possibility to mentor a new Youth Scout. To control scout inflation in the MetaSoccer universe, each scout will be able to mentor up to 5 new scouts during their career. Mentoring has a cost of $MSU that will vary depending on the mentorships done previously. The qualities of the new scout will be inherited directly from his mentors. A weighted average will be made between the Mentoring skills of each mentor, so that the scout with the highest Mentoring value will be the dominant scout in the mentoring. Transfers/Marketplace All assets in the game can be sold on the MetaSoccer marketplace or any other NFT marketplace.

WHAT IS META SOCCER MARKETING STRATEGY MetaSoccer is an ecosystem that combines video games, soccer, and gambling. The integration of the 3 markets with blockchain technology makes MetaSoccer a disruptive cocktail with enormous growth potential. Video Games Market: a recent study reveals that at least 3.1 billion people out of the 8 billion inhabitants worldwide play video games, roughly 40% of the world's population, and the video game industry is growing year after year, generating more revenue than the film and music industries combined. In addition, the new ""Play to Earn"" game mechanics are taking off right now and could cause a paradigm shift in the video game industry, which will result in most game studios being forced to offer ""Play to Earn"" incentives in order to meet the new market demands.Soccer Market: soccer is clearly the most popular sport in terms of fans. Around 3.5 billion people around the world watch soccer at least once a year, which represents 45% of the world's population. And not only is it the most popular sport in the world among fans, but it is also the most popular sport. FIFA estimates that 270 million people officially participate in the sport to some extent. The sports market is expected to reach $599.9 billion by 2025 and $826 billion by 2030.Sports Betting Market: World gambling statistics show that about 26% of the world's population bet. In 2020 alone, the sports betting industry recorded revenues of $203 billion. During 2020-2024, the global sports betting industry is forecast to grow by $144.44 billion, which will be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11%. The introduction of blockchain in sports betting provides a solution to the problems currently generated by bookmakers, adding guaranteed anonymity, trust and security to the process. results: Weld.Money, IEON and Scotty Beam. And right now they have 50+ requests to the launch from a wide range of investors, launchpads and advisors. META SOCCER TOKEN ECONOMY To create a sustainable metaverse which allows a long term users adoption, MetaSoccer decided to implement a Token Bonding Curve (TBC) that has control over the token supply, and continuously mints and burns tokens alongside a mathematical function. An initial supply of 360M $MSU was minted with the purpose of financing the early development & expansion of the game, and rewarding the initial batch of users & the team. 18M out of the 360M are destined to a presale to add liquidity to the TBC and the DAO. After this presale the bonding curve will be open for trading. In MetaSoccer, players have several ways to earn $MSU: Winning matches (simulated according to statistics) against other users in career mode, or against AI in friendly mode;Finishing the season in the top positions of the league or cup in career mode;Selling players who have been discovered by youth scouts;Borrowing players to other teams for a limited period of time;Charging commissions on the sale of future players;Selling youth scouts who have been mentored by members of the team;Getting sponsorship contracts as a team gains popularity;Betting on a winning team;Renting a stadium to other teams;Selling tickets to fans attending the stadium.

ShopNEXT is a Shop-to-Earn Crypto Onboarding Platform promoted by Binance. They onboard new crypto users by rewarding them with free crypto (Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, USDT) when shopping at ShopNEXT partners. In addition, for every shopping transaction, ShopNEXT also rewards users extra NEXT, the cryptocurrency issued by ShopNEXT. Users can sell NEXT on the DEX and CEX exchanges to make money. The Shop-To-Earn model ShopNEXT wants to build up is a world-first. ShopNEXT is backed by Shopiness, the top cashback platform in Vietnam. Shopiness currently has 700.000 users and 100.000 MAU, who generate $4M GMV from 1M transactions monthly. ShopNEXT has already partnered with more than 600 local and global merchant brands such as: Shopee, Lazada, Amazon, Adidas, Booking.com, etc. WHAT MAKES SHOPNEXT UNIQUE? Crypto is a magnet right now, especially in Asia. More than 80% of people in Asia are aware of crypto but only a fraction of them own some coins or tokens. Bringing crypto to the mass is still a big question that needs to be solved. ShopNEXT wants to solve this problem by introducing the first-ever Shop-To-Earn model, which rewards user free crypto while shopping through ShopNEXT app. Earning crypto easily and freely is expected to motivate billions of people to onboard crypto and this is the ShopNEXT vision and mission. Axie Infinity has created the play-to-earn model by combining gaming activities and crypto token economy. The model lifts the whole crypto up and brings lots of awareness from non-crypto people. Playing games is cool, but not everyone is a gamer and these activities can be very time consuming. As such, they thought of a model that can leverage the token economics of crypto and is easy to participate for most people: the answer was shopping. ShopNEXT works as an affiliate marketer to connect users and merchants. The merchant pays ShopNEXT commision, which will be shared 60-70% to users as cashback. Users can convert the cashback to common crypto currency in their Binance wallet. ShopNEXT keeps 30-40% of revenue to buy back NEXT and top-up the community fund. In addition, for every shopping transaction, ShopNEXT also rewards users extra NEXT (the cryptocurrency issued by ShopNEXT), which can be sold to make money. That's how shop-to-earn works. The shop-to-earn token economy model will be a game changer. Just look at how people around the world are going crazy for the play-to-earn trend; we can imagine how the adoption will be when people realize how much they can earn from their daily shopping with ShopNEXT. One of the things that make them stand out from others is that they will not only focus on online shopping but also in-store payments cashback mechanisms. People can just pay at coffee shops, supermarkets or petrol stations and earn crypto rewards. Online shopping is huge, but they believe the potential of offline payments is enormous as well.  WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF SHOPNEXT? When users shop through their mobile apps, they will earn two kinds of rewards. The first one is cashback, which can be withdrawn into common cryptos such as BTC, ETH, BNB to the Binance wallet or NEXT to Metamask. The second reward is NEXT tokens, which are distributed depending on the cashback value, not the price of NEXT on the market. they have different variables such as cashback to NEXT reward ratio, NEXT reward cap per transaction, NEXT reward multiplier for MOONer and total monthly NEXT reward to control the token inflation. There are 2 types of users in their platform: normal users and MOONer, their VIP ones. MOONer will have many more privileges compared to normal users. To become MOONers, users have to lock a certain amount of tokens in their wallets (will be decided 1 week after the IDO). For the first reward, all users will be eligible to earn the Cashback. MOONers will have a chance to earn 20% more cashback. For the second reward, NEXT will be distributed differently between normal users and MOONers. Cashback to NEXT reward ratio: The amount of cashback to reward NEXT to users. At the beginning, it was set at $0.1 to earn 1 NEXT.NEXT reward cap per transaction: The cap of NEXT reward for each transaction. For normal users, it is capped at 1 NEXT, for MOONer it is capped at 100 NEXT/transaction.NEXT reward multiplier for MOONer: Currently, it is 5X. This means for a transaction, a MOONer can be able to earn 5 times NEXT than a normal user.Total number of NEXT rewards monthly: they will cap the max NEXT reward per month and will announce to their users SHOPNEXT ROADMAP  SHOPNEXT REVENUE STREAMS ShopNEXT works as an affiliate marketer. their merchant partners pay ShopNEXT sales commission from 5% to 30% of total transaction value. ShopNEXT shares 60-70% of this commission back to users in crypto and keeps 30-40% as revenue, which will be used to buy back NEXT tokens to top up their Community Fund.  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES SHOPNEXT USE? ShopNEXT is a shop-to-earn crypto onboarding platform. What makes them different is their business strategy to acquire users and engage them. They have 5 years of experience in the cashback business. Shopiness, their backer, is the top 1 cashback and deal platform in VietNam. SHOPNEXT MARKETING STRATEGY This is how they expand into Asia. their marketing strategy is to harmonize owned/earned/paid media and utilize community partnership as much as possible. - Owned media: Shopiness app/web and social commerce communities - Earned media: lifetime referral program - Paid media: Facebook/Google ads and PR/partnership channels At the launching on Q4 2021, they'll enable online shopping crypto cashback in 6 SEA markets (VN, ID, TH, PH, SG, MY). They will leverage their partnerships with Binance Pay and BSC to promote them in foreign markets. They'll prioritize the media budget for VN to reach 50,000 MAU (est 3 months) first before growing users at other 5 SEA markets. When MAU reaches 200,000 in SEA (est 6 months), they'll roll out the expansion plan to Japan, Korea and other Asian markets. SHOPNEXT TOKEN ECONOMY All shopping members will be able to earn NEXT, but normal users will only earn a very little amount of token, mostly for teasing purposes. To earn a high enough quantity of NEXT while shopping, they have to lock a certain amount of NEXT. They will use controllable variables to control the NEXT token inflation, so that a normal shopper who spends roughly $250 a month can expect to earn an amount of token equivalent to $100. Those tiny amounts of NEXT they distribute to the normal users, may actually just sit on the mobile app, not be diluted to the market as not big enough for them to withdraw, that is why they use them as a teasing purpose, so that everyone wants to become MOONer, to strive to earn more. To control the demand-side of NEXT, they make the MOON level very attractive and accessible, so that people are willing to buy and stake NEXT to become MOONer. Once the NEXT price is high, which makes the entry level of MOON level also high, they can organise flash sales to recruit more MOONers, who may stake less tokens than usual. To encourage people to hold more tokens, they run a campaign called MOOners of the Month (MOTM) monthly. A big pool of rewards will be given to the top 10 who hold the most tokens, make the most referrals and make the most shopping orders. They will use the rest of their revenue (after sharing 60-70% to users as cashback) to buy back NEXT from the market quarterly to top-up their community reward fund. They have many monetizing in-app mini games that will encourage users to engage with their app better and those NEXT paid by users in participating games will be sent to their community reward fund.   	7726	0.0019414962464405902	0.0002588661661920787	0.0034946932435930625

Bitlocus ""Fiat-DeFi Investments Management Platform"" is a complete investing ecosystem that allows end users to invest their fiat assets into DeFi space easily without actually directly interacting with crypto.The platform will be built on existing centralized exchange (Bitlocus CEX, established in 2018), which is fully AML and KYC-compliant and has a few fiat deposit/withdrawal options. Bitlocus is in partnership with Payrico, a crypto-friendly banking service (EMI, Electronic Money Institution; licenced in Lithuania, EU) as well as Ginger Fund (crypto-oriented hedge fund and liquidity provider). End users are provided with Tier 1 investment options from trusted DeFi projects that will be categorized based on their risk level. There will also be an insurance option for DeFi investments made via Bitlocus platform. WHAT MAKES BITLOCUS SO UNIQUE? Target market is EU deposit market valued at $17T (or 14.65T EUR) which lacks higher yield opportunities that DeFi can offer. To manage a $1B portfolio you only need to penetrate the market by 0.00625%.Making a complaint and easy way in-and-out of DeFi products with fiat currencies, Bitlocus will create a risk-mitigated bridge that will do both - bring in new money to the crypto ecosystem as well as benefit fiat-based clients with higher yield products in a safer, easier and cheaper manner. Bitlocus DeFi investments platform itself will utilize Terra blockchain-based token BTL to incentivize their crypto supporters via the reward programs as well as will feature some basic utilities such as paying reduced fees on their CEX platform. BITLOCUS ROADMAP  BITLOCUS REVENUE STREAMS Bitlocus CeDeFi revenue streams will be solely based on fiat users' fees. Once fiat user invests to DeFi via Bitlocus platform it will charge: 0.5% deposit fee (once per investment),Will include a minor investment premium (less than 10%)As well as have fees for optional Guarantee fund (1-2% annually). Since all fees are paid in fiat and rewards are in BTL token, Bitlocus will use part of revenue to buy a corresponding amount of BTL token from the market. This creates some additional and organic demand for the token. Other revenue streams will be used for: Bitlocus BTL buyback program with quarterly token burn events (up until 30% of total supply is burned)B2B partner rewards for acquiring new fiat user (affiliate-like program)Guarantee fund allocation  HOW DOES BITLOCUS WORK? Bitlocus serves two main client types: fiat and crypto-based. They both will be able to act in the same Bitlocus ecosystem, but will not interact with each other directly (estimated overlap of users in both communities is about 5%) due to the main idea behind this product: fiat users do not interact with crypto directly - the platform processes it all to/from DeFi ecosystem this way making it cheaper, faster and safer. For Fiat-based Users The CeDeFi platform is heavily based on Bitlocus centralized exchange (est 2018) which acts as fiat on/off ramp with fully compliant KYC and AML procedures with SEPA, SWIFT payments and multiple crypto assets. Main product advantages for fiat-based users: Easy to use one-stop-shop (CEX & DeFi).Main risks mitigated.Tier1 DeFi protocols/investments.No specific crypto or DeFi knowledge is required. All interactions are Fiat-based.Cheap and easy way in (0.5%) & out (free).No minimum investment period or amount requirements.SEPA/SWIFT/Card paymentsCrypto-friendly IBAN option from the trusted partner - Payrico (electronic money institution with European licence).Optional Guarantee fund service. For Crypto-based Users Bitlocus will serve fee discounts for CEX services and will host CeDeFi's Guarantee Fund reward program. Liquidity providing, liquidity mining and other/future DeFi programs will be hosted on the 3rd party platforms. Main product advantages for BTL hodlers: Constantly available rewards programsBTL token buyback and burn programThe constant demand for BTL tokens from the ecosystem itself (fiat used to buy BTL in order to reward crypto users via reward programs).Reduced CEX feesToken bridge to other chains (like Ethereum and BSC).

The game has been developed by Topebox, one of the most popular game studios in Vietnam. Titan Hunters is Topebox’s latest project - an attempt at disrupting the mobile gaming industry with the power of NFT. Target: 10 million downloads 1. Utilizing Topebox's game portfolio  Topebox development team is behind global smash hits like Sky Dancer (Top 1 Game in US & China; Acquired by Bytedance for publishing rights in China; Google Play Editor Choice; and Best Indie Game by Apple) and Gun N Dungeons (incoming Hit Game with backing from Miniclip, a Tencent-owned European game publishing powerhouse with over 1 billion app downloads).  Titan Hunters will be marketed to and promoted to this massive audience of over 50 million+ users through in-app notifications, promotional events, email marketing campaigns, retargeting campaigns and other traditional marketing strategies. 2. Influencer Marketing and Gaming Guilds Titan Hunters has already onboarded some of the biggest game streamers and influencers across Youtube, twitch and twitter like kmanu88, thewillyrex, etc. Once the game beta launch is released, the team plans on onboarding more gaming influencers to target pro gaming audience.  However, since the game is geared towards the casual everyday audience, influencer marketing will expand to getting more regular streamers and personalities. The team has also inked partnerships with many Gaming guilds. This would give a massive foundational platform for the game to be promoted and played by thousands of users from the get go. In addition, Manu Terronos Godoy has come on board as Game advisor to help reach and develop into newer markets.  3. Paid ads and Affiliates The team will go on a marketing blitzkrieg once the game launches by undertaking a variety of paid advertising campaigns across both digital mediums and print/traditional media. Their affiliate marketing and PPC campaigns had been hugely successful for previous game releases and the team will utilize all that they've learnt in the last 5 years to ensure the game reaches as many people as possible. 4. Social Media: Community Engagement Community building has been one of the cornerstones of the team's marketing campaign since the start of the project with deep focus on creating a long term, sustainable community that believes in the project and the $TITA token itself.  The team plans to continue to build this forward by focusing more on crypto community focused campaigns, incentivizing not just regular players and token holders but folks who become part of the Titan Hunters family after the IDO.  5. Alpha game release, and Campaigns around it The most favored and centralized focus of the marketing campaign after IDO will be Alpha game release. They have a fully functioning demo game that is already very popular among the community. This will be built on after the IDO with contests around it such as best player contest, player of the day, daily top scorers and other activities revolving around it.  They plan on partnering with other projects and running campaigns around the alpha game as well, and once the beta launch is released, a full scale campaign blitzkrieg around it. 6. Localized focus Focusing on localized communities. specifically Latin American countries, Asian communities of Vietnam, the Philippines, Korea, Japan, China. This is the initial target audience simply due to the popularity of mobile gaming in these regions, and are also considered as crypto's main FOMO audience. They will be engaged with localized content, community engagement, contests and giveaways. When the IDO is over, an ambassador program will be started wherein they will have the most active community members themselves spreading the word about Titan Hunters across the crypto universe in order to educate and promote it to newer folks. 7. NFT sales and campaign Titan Hunters is Free 2 Play, Invest 2 Earn game. This means while the game itself is free 2 play and targeted towards casual, everyday gamers; there are loads of NFT features and in-game items apart from character skins and characters which can be bought on the NFT marketplace either as character packages or lootboxes.  Limited Edition Character skins and packages will have special attributes and functionality within the game, apart from being a a unique PFP asset in the Titan Hunters Metaverse. This would give the NFTs sales an very specific utility that can double up as a speculative investment.  Lootboxes and in-game items on the other hands can help users power up and play the game better and become more immersive. The first round of NFT sale for Character Skins and Avatars are planned to take place around Alpha game release, which would be within 3 weeks after IDO.

KAKA NFT WORLD is a competitive gaming ecosystem platform focusing on the metaverse blockchain gaming sector. It is committed to combining the application of NFT+DEFI in the ecosystem, constructing a cross-chain bridge based on the concept of global decentralization, integrating various licensed IPs of global brands, and creating Decentralized Autonomous Management (DAO). It aims to create a prediction agreement perpendicular to the e-sports prediction market, and an open, transparent, decentralized, and complete project for the ecosystem. The main sectors are divided into the two following categories: providing services such as R&D, sales, trading, circulation, e-sports, and trendy games for game and art NFTs; focusing on the prediction market in the field of e-sports (Prediction Market). WHAT MAKES KAKA NFT UNIQUE? KAKA brings the metaverse's blockchain-based gaming ecosystem and token usecase to another level. KAKA has crypto assets deployed on multiple public chains and also applied cross-chain technology. KAKA tokens can be used for liquidity mining and staking in the KAKA site. KAKA introduced licensed IPs to mint NFT Cards which can be used for playing games and also developed crypto avatars as metaverse keys and granted exclusive privileges to the holders of these keys. KAKA has a deflation mechanism where 20% NFT cards are burned through each round. The supply of cards in circulation decreases along with the battles.  WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF KAKA NFT? Gaming Sector Troland- Play-to-earn Game. Troland is an original gaming IP created by KAKA NFT World. There are 110 types of cards designed in the game, with each type corresponding to a character from Troland. They each have their own story backgrounds and skills. All cards are ranked in 10 rarity levels: the higher the rarity level, the rarer they are in circulation. KAKA's Troland card game utilizes blockchain technology to control the cards' rarity and supply. Each card is bonded with a unique token based on blockchain technology (ERC-721 and ERC-1155). This token identifies the card type and amount uniquely, preventing forgeries. The entire game will issue a total of 512,611,000 cards. Through the online matches, cards are gradually burned. Thus, the total market circulation amount will consistently decline.Other games. (The 2nd game will be revealed at the end of this year) NFT Sector NFT combined with Hot IPs. All NFT with IPs issued by KAKA can be used for staking.Crypto Avatar-KAKA Rabbits. KAKA rabbit is an upgraded version of the metaverse key product launched previously by KAKA NFT. The main part of the product is the NFT based on the ERC721 standard for the blockchain, and each configuration has its own unique rabbit image design. Since KAKA NFT is the world's leading game and anime IP value aggregation platform, all rabbit image designs will have some IP collaboration designs that are both interesting and rare. Since KAKA rabbit is not just a simple NFT avatar, she is the metaverse key of KAKA NFT. Therefore, her holders will enjoy a series of privileges and functions that keyholders should enjoy. This makes the KAKA-rabbit a very wise long-term investment. There will only be 10,000 pieces of KAKA Rabbit across the world, without any duplication. KAKA's rabbit will be different from the other computer-generated avatar NFTs. KAKA NFT World as the dark horse in the metaverse blockchain gaming field released the limited-edition CG artwork avatars collection- KAKA Rabbit. This collection offers at least three benefits.1. Metaverse identity verification with unique design, and no replication.2. It's an upgraded metaverse key of KAKA NFT World which allows holders to enjoy exclusive airdrops.3. Kaka Rabbit will have its own fashion toys company and the avatar holder will share a certain amount of the income from the revenue of the fashion toy that corresponds to his or her avatar. Platform Sector KAKA owns it's own gaming investment research team. It will work with the DAO community to push more quality gaming projects to the market through KAKA's platform. The platform and its modules will be opened to the public in the future so IP owners can use the ready modules to create their own independent games. KAKA NFT ROADMAP  KAKA NFT REVENUE STREAMS Game players buy NFT cards to play in the game. The basic price of each card is at least 0.1u. Players need a minimum of 5 cards to participate in the battle. For-profit guilds such as YGG have already settled in and will bring lots of professional players and users to participate in KAKA's first game, Troland.The NFT sales from the platform's crypto-avatar KAKA Rabbit: a total of 10,000 Rabbits, each with a price tag of $399 USD, and an expected total revenue of $3.99 million USD .KAKA Rabbit will authorize the IP to the Chinese community, develop physical products such as toys, and has opened the industrial chain from production to e-commerce, such as on the official flagship store of Disney store in JD and other online sales platforms.As an NFT blockchain gaming platform, KAKA will open the game's backend. B-end users can open their own Troland games with their own IPs. During this process, only a certain amount of KAKA platform tokens is required for staking. This part of KAKA tokens will be released to these entrepreneurial teams and institutions after the lock-up period is over. KAKA will charge a nominal commission fee and service fee during the period.  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES KAKA NFT USE? NFTs deployed through EIP721 protocol, powered by multi-chains, such as Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, OKEx Chain, and Conflux Chain,etc.$KAKA deployed on Binance Smart Chain.Cross-Chain bridged digital assets between BSC and other public chains that are compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) such as ETH, OEC and HECO etc. Block hash is used to ensure the uniqueness of tokens on different chains, as well as to obtain synchronized NFT information on different chains with the help of a cluster of nodes built of ECDSA.EIP721 protocol deployed to develop the NFT.Blockchain game Troland deployed in multi-chains.Cocos Creator- Blockchain game engine.There are also type design and casting interface systems that can work with the unique tokenId in the NFT contract. When cross-chain, re-opening mechanism, repurchase mechanism and game battle destruction all function well at the same time, the value and liquidity of NFT can still meet expectations. KAKA NFT MARKETING STRATEGY First, the platform establishes branding and global positioning by signing up contracts with world renown anime and gaming IPs to mint NFTs so as to attract followers from these IPs to KAKA's platform. In this process, KAKA also cultivated her official IP brands such as KAKA Chan and KAKA Rabbit from scratch. As they foresee that as the NFT market gets more attention and more international anime & gaming IPs getting acquired, further acquiring IPs will be much harder, this will prove unconducive to long-term development. Later, through the integration of these IPs and the metaverse track, they will launch a series of games, including collectible card games, battle games, simulation games, role-playing games, etc. KAKA will launch different games in phases, and open their interfaces when the games are mature, so that more startups and teams who want to develop blockchain games can use KAKA's gaming platform and interfaces to quickly complete their game development and online operations. This will greatly reduce their development time and cost and further ensure that their games have a good economic logic by using KAKA platform's token economic model. In this process, KAKA will receive the support of many institutions and game development teams. Currently, more than 10 teams have signed contracts and will use KAKA's platform interface to quickly launch their blockchain games, which will increase the overall user count of KAKA. This will mean great potential for KAKA's future market value and user base. KAKA NFT TOKEN ECONOMY The total supply of the platform token $KAKA is 100 millions.

The upcoming NFTs developed by KAKA will support KAKA tokens as means of payment and gas fee for minting. 4. KAKA tokens will effectively support more payment scenarios, including the dividend distributions for the KAKA Rabbit brand physical products. $KAKA can be obtained through DEFI and Gamefi. Users can earn $KAKA through mainstream token staking, NFT licensed with IP staking, liquidity mining and play-to-earn gaming. Token holders can use tokens to buy items in the game(these tokens will then be burned). Token holders can also use tokens to buy NFTs or staking.

Bemil is an entertaining game with galaxy theme and Play to Earn feature, in which players can engage in battles, build clans, play minigames and other features. Developed by BEMIL MT INTERNATIONAL DOO, the game has been under amazing growth since it was first officially released on Google Play last quarter, with over 15,000 active users by August 31th and robust growth rate of 5% per day. Led by Mr Han Nguyen - founder of Fado.vn, the game have been developing since 2020, with the aims to maximise the interest of three parties – developers, investors & players. The game already have existing tokens system. Bemil expects to make itself a long-lasting project, unlike many games which were born in a hurry to follow the NFT gaming trend these days. With the combination of mobile app gaming and marketing potential, the growth of Bemil is not limited like most crypto projects. WHAT MAKES BEMIL A UNIQUE GAME? There are many types of Play 2 Earn games on the market today. Each type has its own strengths. With BEMIL, they focus on the gamers by building and updating attractive gameplay to bring the best gaming experience to the players. Coming from game makers, they are very focused on game content and the entertainment that their games bring. Furthermore, players are rewarded for this entertainment. In addition, most BEMIL players are non-crypto traders, so they focus more on the gameplay, so they tend to invest in the gaming longer. Bemil distinguishes itself from other games, since it's a semi-blockchain game, with its own off-chain token (BeCoin). Players will need to use BEM (on-chain coin), to purchase BeCoin within the game, and use BeCoin for trading within the game. More importantly, its market-growth strategy is totally different from NFT games, as they mostly focus on crypto audience, meanwhile, Bemil also focuses on the mass audience, with a proven working business model. BEMIL ROADMAP  BEMIL REVENUE MODEL  HOW DOES BEMIL WORK? The purpose of the game is to participate in wars to mine/get Becoin using your whole mining system, which is based on three factors - The damage your system received - The level of the core - The number of gears the player has Each gear has its own skill. For example, the Fire Gear has the ability to double the mining speed. However, for these abilities to be activated, a player needs to have gears of 5 different colours. To improve these factors, players need to participate in different game modes, including Spin & Attack, Clan wars, Prison Mode, Tower Defense and World Boss Fight. TECHNOLOGIES USED BY BEMIL At the moment, users deposit USDT into its trading platform at https://bewallet.com to buy an internal token called Becoin. Becoin will be used to buy items in-game (starter packs, shields, gems, gold, etc.), to open gacha and access other features (identified coin - SSI), etc. $BEM is born to replace USDT, users will need to deposit $BEM instead of $USDT like before. The increasing demand of Becoin will bring along the demand for $BEM. WHAT IS BEMIL GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY? Bemil has acquired 15,000 users, generated $400,000 in revenue & 5.7% growth rate per day after over a month of launching in the Philippines. They achieved this by using an influencers network and digital ads (as they are also a successful Marketing agency and MMO company). An example of what they have been doing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hySTwphSTu8 After the IDO, they will take 2 different approaches at the same time: Crypto marketing: In this approach, they will do crypto marketing at a global scale like other crypto gaming projects using influencers (Telegram, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook), third-party platforms (exchanges, coinmarketcap, blockfolio, etc.) and co-branding with other projects. Since the incubator Faraland has a lot of connections in this field, they will get a lot of help in this areaMass-market marketing: They will continue doing what they have been doing previously with the influencers network, digital ads & affiliate marketing (product growth-hacking). They have been expanding the network in Asia with more than 100m+ followers and going to reach out to Africa & South America soon. As Bemil is actually a business with a positive cash flow, high user growth and a very experienced marketing team, they expect to have no trouble in acquiring new users in both terms of budget & strategy.

27	blockasset	105000	12	NFT	other	 DAO Maker 	0.0	1.0	blockasset	09/12/21	solana	29	12	"WHAT IS BLOCKASSET? Blockasset leverages strategic relationships with athletes, sports agencies, and sports clubs and connects them with fans on a one-stop athlete NFT platform. The platform will have four core components: A blockchain NFT (non-fungible-token) marketplace - this is the central hub of the Blockasset ecosystem, a custom/white label athlete NFT marketplace facility for major sports brands and organisations, a community rewards and staking system build into the platform, and an NFT gaming suite. Together the components create the intertwined Blockasset ecosystem where fans and athletes have multiple touch points which support virtual and real-world engagement. The ecosystem has a native utility token called BLOCK token, which has various functions including governance, NFT discounts, priority access, athlete content governance, staking and NFT farming. Blockasset understands that 90%+ of sports fans have never purchased an NFT, they're very early, so making the process of purchasing, storing, and selling NFTs as easy as possible for the mainstream is their key objective as they build their platform. The Blockasset platform will include social wallet set ups with no wallet/private key management required plus a fiat payment option, ensuring any sports fan can purchase an NFT from their favourite athlete without needing extensive cryptocurrency knowledge. Blockasset has also built in a custom NFT creator, to ensure new users can mint their first NFT for free on Blockasset and start their collection. The key to a successful NFT ecosystem and connecting fans to athletes is the NFT utility that stays ingrained into the NFT. Blockasset's generative NFTs provide unique perks including NFT airdrops, access to exclusive communities, with the ability to chat with athletes in real time, and real world perks including signed merchandise and athlete meet ups. A key component of the Blockasset ecosystem is the Asset Hub, a staking and NFT farm. An exclusive reward token called ASSET may be obtained by staking BLOCK tokens and NFTs on the Blockasset staking platform, the Asset Hub. The ASSET token will be the only method for accessing custom NFT drops on the platform - they call this 'NFT farming'. Blockasset will include full social and community integration into the platform. Blockasset users and community members will be able to earn BLOCK and ASSET rewards through staking, as mentioned above, but they will also be eligible for further token rewards based on their contribution to the Blockasset ecosystem and community, tracked by platform usage and social media integration. WHAT MAKES BLOCKASSET UNIQUE? As of today there are a number of sports based NFT projects, however many of these sports NFT platforms are well known for crossing over into the entertainment industry, producing NFTs for films, musicians and actors, take Ethernity and Autograph as an example, although they clearly see sports a a major aspect of their products, they are not solely concentrated on the sports market. Blockasset are, for now, a sports only platform, once they have a fully built platform and userbase they can begin to branch into other areas that their user base may find attractive. Most sporting NFT platforms only concern themselves with one sport, football being a prime example. Blockasset is the only sports and athlete-centric NFT platform that caters to all sports. Blockasset stands above their competitors in many ways, one of the key reasons they are ahead of any competitors is their Blockchain of choice, Solana, which is now well established as the go to blockchain for NFTs and NFT collectors thanks to it's extremely low (almost non-existent) fees and super fast transaction speeds. The speed and cheap fees on Solana ensure Blockasset can give users an unmatched user experience; many sports fans have never purchased an NFT before, on Blockasset, they can be assured of a seamless first experience, meaning they have a much higher retention rate compared to their competitors built on other blockchains. Low transaction fees also mean Blockasset can airdrop NFTs and rewards to its users on a mass scale, not possible on many other chains. Blockasset build with their community in mind, the product and NFT ecosystem is being built to give token holders governance over the future of the project, many projects build what they think their customers or community want, with the BLOCK token they can inform their already strong community and allow them to have a say in how they build Blockasset. They plan to fully integrate the platform with Discord and Twitter, meaning they can track community participation and platform usage and reward its community based on this participation. Even if a user does not have the funds to buy tokens or an NFT, they can still earn rewards by being a strong member of the community. Blockasset wants to bridge the gap between fans and athletes, with its community centric platform and ecosystem, and a governance token at its center, they will be able to reward their users with athlete based real world prizes, they are more than an NFT platform, they are an athlete connectivity platform. Users can access a number of rewards that bring them closer to athletes by staking tokens, NFTs and being a strong member of the community. Their strong links with world class athletes mean they can reward users with meet and greets with athletes, signed merchandise, video calls with athletes, messages from athletes and much more. They will also host regular athlete AMAs and fantasy sports leagues in their community Discord, with priority given to token and NFT holders. These athlete connections cannot be found on any other platform. WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF BLOCKASSET? NFT Marketplace The heart of the platform is a marketplace for blockchain NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Blockasset collectible NFTs are securely minted on the blockchain, which tracks and records the ownership and authenticity of the underlying asset. They are fully aware that not all sports fans are well versed in the NFT and cryptocurrency landscape and they accept responsibility for onboarding newcomers and educating them about the power of blockchain and NFTs. All new users to Blockasset will be given their own personalised NFT upon signing up, this will be unique to them, containing their username and even a custom sporting avatar that they create themselves. Users will also be able to purchase NFTs using PayPal or a Credit/Debit card and even sign up using a social account like Twitter or Facebook, with no need to create and store a private seed phrase. These core components will provide a smooth onboarding experience for users that maybe sceptical of NFTs when purchasing NFTs for the first time. Plans are in place to encourage NFT collecting, as users will have their own sticker book style pages, showcasing all of their Blockasset NFTs. The existing problem for fans is that platforms like OpenSea provide thousands of results when searching for a well-known athlete, this is a terrible experience for any buyer of a real authenticated piece. Adding to that, these large platforms are unable to currently offer any tailored pages to the athletes, buying an NFT on OpenSea is a bland experience with a plain white background, there's no excitement! Blockasset solves this problem by minting only authenticated pieces, with each athlete having their custom marketplace page. Users will be able to buy and sell NFTs on the Blockasset Marketplace, with discounts for users who pay with BLOCK tokens. A percentage of these BLOCK tokens will be burned, reducing the overall token supply. Asset Hub - Staking Platform An exclusive reward token called ASSET may be obtained by staking BLOCK tokens and NFTs on the Blockasset staking platform, the Asset Hub. The ASSET token will be the only method for accessing custom NFT drops on the platform - they call this 'NFT farming'. These custom NFTs will include rewards for their gaming suite, real world athlete rewards, access to exclusive Discord channels, priority access to NFT drops and even access to beta test new features, the possibilities are endless. This reduces the amount of BLOCK in circulation, whilst rewarding token holders for their loyalty. NFT farming will be a core component of the Blockasset ecosystem. The farm is not limited to BLOCK token holders, all Blockasset NFT holders will be able stake their NFTs in to receive ASSET tokens and even gain further bonus rewards for doing so. By offering staking with incredible rewards they can ensure NFT re-sales on the open market are reduced, reducing supply and increasing demand. Governance Portal The BLOCK token is primarily a governance token, which allows users to propose and vote on key decisions that impact the future of the project. A full governance portal will be built to allow users to easily propose new votes and then vote on these proposals. A full governance process with checks and balances will be built in to ensure transparency and fairness for users. Blockasset will also reward user for taking part in votes, to ensure a wide range of users are making their voices heard. BlockAccess - Athlete Content Hub To complement the real world perks, all token and NFT owners will receive exclusive access to BlockAccess, an athlete content series produced by Blockasset and its community. These behind the scenes clips will grant fans exclusive access into the lives of athletes, fans will see what it takes to prepare for a match or fight and then bask in the glory of a winning changing room. Token holders will be credited as producers, as BlockAccess athlete content ideas will be decided by fans via a BlockAccess governance portal. Fans can choose what we film with athletes and even what style of film, be it serious documentary or fun day out. Producers will then gain exclusive access to the series before it's shown anywhere else, with live premiers shown on their community Discord channel. Community Ecosystem & Social Integration Blockasset will include full social and community integration into the platform. Blockasset users and community members will be able to earn BLOCK and ASSET rewards through staking, as mentioned above, but they will also be eligible for further token rewards based on their contribution to the Blockasset ecosystem and community. Discord will be integrated into the ecosystem, meaning a user can link their Blockasset community ID on Discord to their wallet, creating a seamless experience for the user, and enabling Blockasset to identify and reward their greatest users with more athlete perks. BLOCKASSET ROADMAP  BLOCKASSET REVENUE STREAMS NFT sales - Blockasset releases official and verified NFTs with well known athletes, Blockasset splits the gross revenue with the athlete(s) and the NFT artist, the percentage split is determined on a case by case basis with the athlete and artist. NFT re-sales - Blockasset has a regular source of revenue from the re-sales of our NFTs, for their Legends NFT collection Blockasset collects a 7% cut of each NFT resale, which is split with the athlete and artist. All Blockasset NFTs have continued utility and use case to ensure re-sales revenue is consistent.  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES BLOCKASSET USE? Solana Blockchain. Solana uses a form of consensus relating to ""Proof of History"" and can process transactions at high speed and low cost. This mitigates the poor user experience (high fees and slow speeds) on current NFT marketplaces and allows us to lower the barrier to entry for newcomers to the NFT and crypto scene. We see Solana as the holy trinity of blockchain thanks to low fees, security, and speed. Many high-profile projects such as FTX Derivatives and, more recently, Power Ledger now run on the Solana blockchain. We expect to onboard newcomers into crypto and NFTs in a smooth and hassle-free way, thus growing the global marketplace and raising the profile of the entire space. Since sports fans are not generally crypto natives - this is good, and, of course, no more $70 fees on NFT purchases!Ethereum Blockchain. Some BLOCK tokens will be bridged over to the Ethereum Blockchain, Ethereum is the most well known blockchain in the crypto world with the most liquidity and ease of access.RUST. Blockasset's on-chain programs use the Rust programming language.Metaplex. The digital assets on the Blockasset platform will be minted via the Metaplex facility for NFTs. BLOCKASSET MARKETING STRATEGY Initial Phase Existing Solana NFT users. Blockasset recently sold out its first major NFT collection, The Legends Collection, a set of 10,000 official generative NFTs featuring Muhammad Ali, Wayne Rooney, Alex Ovechkin, Jonah Lomu and Michael Bisping. It's difficult to know how many of these users were first time NFT buyers, however, they marketed the NFTs primarily to existing Solana NFT users as they knew there was a market of buyers there. This is stage 1, building a community of NFT and sports enthusiasts who have existing knowledge of crypto and NFTs. From this they have built an incredible community of Legends NFT holders who are now loyal to Blockasset and understand their vision. Development During the development phase Blockasset will look to build out its platform and ecosystem with constant feedback from their community. During this stage Blockasset will build out the following functionality: A fully working marketplace that accepts BLOCK tokens and Fiat as payment, essential to onboard new users to the NFT spaceEasy set up with no barriers - users can set up a wallet and sign in with a social account, no crypto or wallet knowledge requiredA staking platform that rewards BLOCK token holders and NFT holdersFull community integration - seamless integration with Discord, Twitter and a user's Blockasset account, meaning users can earn points, level up and be rewarded for buying NFTs, participating in the community and using different aspects of the platform.A user 'sticker book' page - users will be able to view their NFTs and bring back childhood memories of collecting, which can improve functionality as a user levels up.Governance portal - token holders will be able to govern the Blockasset ecosystem by submitting proposals and voting on key decisions. Growth Phase Once the Blockasset platform is fully operational, they will begin it's growth phase, which will consist of onboarding sports brands, agencies and teams onto the platform. Blockasset currently deals directly with athletes, but they have very strong connections with sports teams, agencies and brands that want an NFT solution ready for mass adoption. With their own marketplace already built, Blockasset can onboard new users by working with large sporting organisations, giving them access to thousands of athletes and their fans, something not possible on an athlete-by-athlete basis. Adoption Once they have an existing and established user base and a product built for their users, they can build on this by attempting to crack the mainstream sports fans who have yet to enter the NFT space. By building on Solana Blockasset already has fast transaction times and almost non-existent fees, which is a huge barrier to adoption on other chains. The next barrier in place is wallet set up, which can be a daunting challenge for many new users. Blockasset is well placed to break down this final barrier to mainstream adoption, they are working closely with Torus, a wallet application that allows users to set up a wallet with a social account (Twitter, Facebook, Discord), Google account or just an email address. The user does not need to know about or store a seed phrase, meaning a new user can simply log into the Blockasset platform with a social account as they've done on countless other sites. Once set up Blockasset will have fiat payment options available on the marketplace, meaning a user can purchase an NFT without having to purchase any crypto. Of course, they want their users to be aware of crypto as it's essential to the success of their token; once a user signs up with their social account they can contact them directly and educate them over time, they will use the connections they have with athletes to increase trust with their users. The team knows that they are still early in the NFT space, but with these tools in place and with elite athletes by their side educating new users, they will be well placed as the go to NFT platform for mainstream sports fans. Adoption comes from educating the mainstream audience, but also by educating the Blockasset athletes themselves. Blockasset educates each athlete it works with to ensure they understand the NFT space and embrace it, meaning they can then educate their fans on the NFTs and crypto space. Once the adoption stage is reached Blockasset will be ready to launch its first Play-To-Earn game. Athletes are already signed up and onboard for the game, and by this stage Blockasset will have a user base of sports fans and NFT enthusiasts ready to embrace the game. BLOCKASSET TOKEN ECONOMY Discounts on the Blockasset marketplace when purchasing NFTs with BLOCK10% of all NFT sales on the Blockasset marketplace will be used to buy and burn BLOCK tokens When BLOCK tokens that are used to purchase NFTs on the Blockasset marketplace, a percentage of these tokens will be burned. A key component of the Blockasset platform is their staking hub, here users will be able to stake NFTs and BLOCK tokens, they will then earn a second token called ASSET token, which only has value on the staking hub, users can save up these tokens and exchange them for a number of rewards, including real world athlete rewards, golden tickets with early access to future drops, Legends NFTs and even BLOCK token rewards. Users will be able to boost their rewards by staking BLOCK tokens and certain NFTs at the same time. Blockasset also plans to introduce single asset staking into the same staking hub platform, meaning users can earn BLOCK tokens and ASSET tokens at the same time without having to choose between the two options. Governance and voting - token holders propose and vote on community and project improvements/changes Athlete governance - token holders produce athlete content. Users decide what they film with their athletes and tell us what type of athlete content they want to see. "	18379	0.0025028565210294357	5.440992437020512e-05	0.002938135915991077

YIN Finance aims to provide proactive liquidity management services on different public chains and decentralized exchanges. In simple terms, YIN Finance is a multi-strategy NFT liquidity optimizer for Defi users. Currently, it is deployed on Ethereum and will be deployed on Polygon and Solana soon. WHAT MAKES YIN FINANCE UNIQUE? Visor and YIN share the principles in active liquidity management, In comparison to Charm Finance's passive liquidity management. Based on which YIN and Visor provide services. And we both have a strategy lab: Gamma Labs(Visor), and Shadow Labs(YIN).However, major distinctions exist. YIN Finance is not only devoted to partnerships with protocols and other DeFi projects in the industry but also strives to increase user experience for individual liquidity providers. In our Phase 1, YIN focuses on Liquidity providing strategy (Market Making on DEX). When arbitrum is ready, YIN will deploy to L2 and Release quantitative market-making products. And the key factor is: YIN can support BSC and Polygon, DODO is one of our investors. YIN will be an exclusive financial product platform supported by them (In BSC and Polygon). YIN Finance allows user-created strategies, and the platform provides low-volatility/stablecoins strategy, third-party protocols, interoperability supported for optimized strategy capacity.  YIN FINANCE ROADMAP  YIN FINANCE REVENUE MODEL  HOW DOES YIN FINANCE WORK? YIN Finance consists of 4 modules: YINYangCHIGrand Master What is $YIN? As YIN Finance's native token, $YIN token plays an important role in the whole ecosystem. What is ""YANG""? YANG is your personal smart vault accessible on YIN Finance's MaiNet. All subsequent asset management actions and processes will be performed from your YANG smart vault, thus maintaining custody of assets and effectively ensuring the fund's security. Users can invest their personal assets in YANG to generate LPNFT, and then subscribe to CHI which is our platform's programmable strategy in order to obtain staking revenue. What is a ""CHI""? CHI is a programmable smart strategy where users can choose between pre-made strategies that will automatically move their liquidity around while asset prices are within certain ranges. In the beginning, all CHI strategies will be provided by the YIN team through Shadow Labs, a premium research institution responsible for the research and development of active liquidity strategies, users will be able to apply to create their own CHIs as YIN Finance grows and matures. To better understand how CHI works, let's take a look at the following example. Hypothetically, let's say you deposit liquidity to a BTC / USDT pool. In this example, let's say 1 bitcoin is worth 50,000 USD. In addition, let's say your CHI is a BTC strategy with a range of 45 - 55k. In this situation, if bitcoin fell sharply out of your range to say, 40k for example, a portion of your liquidity would have converted automatically into bitcoin as people rush to sell-off. With Chi instead, it would automatically swap a certain amount of your BTC in the pool into USDT in advance, while reallocating some liquidity around the 40k price range to avoid impermanence loss while allowing you to regain returns from your assets. The strategy would immediately adjust your liquidity balance in the pool when bitcoin hit $45k, so to prevent the liquidity pool from automatically rebalancing even more of your USDT into Bitcoin as it falls. What is ""Grand Master""? Grand Master is a leverage pool feature that will be available soon on the MainNet. Users who do not want to add liquidity on our platform just yet should consider this feature where your assets can be leveraged up to 10x, proportional to the amount you hold. （Note: will be launched on V2) TECHNOLOGIES USED BY YIN FINANCE Web frontend based on React + TailwindCSS+ web3.jsSmart contract is written by solidityLayer1/Layer2 it will be built on: Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, BSC and Solan, Arbitrum. WHAT IS YIN FINANCE MARKETING STRATEGY? There is a ""YinYang Master"" ambassador plan which now has 20 people selected from different regions such as Russian England and Turkey, including governance proposals, becoming an open platform, and applying for The next term of Defi Alliance membership. At the same time, the platform will introduce more assets and trading pairs that users care about. Multi-chain deployments can also attract traffic on different chains. In fact, their investment institutions will also help to build local communities. Only by binding interests can they better promote the market. Investors will be selected based on what resources they can provide for the project, rather than just financial screening. There will also be many campaigns on Twitter, including daily quizzes, meme contests, bug bounties, AMA and educational videos. Some in-depth assessment articles will be written later to let global users know the differences between the products. External project cooperation is also slowly advancing, for now we have DODO, Polygon, Parsiq, Wepiggy, Parami, 1sol, GoPocket, Desyn and more coming out… Collaborate with DeFi KOLs, private farmers, DeFi communities.

The ReSource Protocol provides a comprehensive toolbox for the creation of distributed mutual credit systems that grant participants access to 0% interest credit, further collaborative commerce, and give rise to a new class of stablecoins. Instead of ""renting"" capital from a bank or lender, network-participants form a multi-sided lending system in which businesses extend credit to each other. However, they don't do so with fiat or even crypto assets. Instead, the ReSource protocol allows participants to monetize what businesses already have: unused inventory, free labour time, and all resources comprising their enterprise. Participants lend these unutilized resources to peers that need them, and in return - receive from the network what they need themselves to expand their own business. This multilateral exchange network utilizes an endogenously created money supply as a medium of exchange, which comes into existence as a result of transactions among participants. This endogenously created money is a new form of stablecoin which achieves autonomous stability. This means that ReSource stablecoins are not artificially pegged to fiat or other assets, but derive their stable value from the goods and services traded with them. WHAT MAKES RESOURCE FINANCE SO UNIQUE? While many projects pride themself in their efforts to ""Decentralize Finance"", the ReSource network does not only disarm intermediaries and custodians but decentralizes the logic of credit itself, effectively removing the creditor from the equation. Beyond that, ReSource introduces a series of features, unheard of in the crypto industry: Users are not required to stake assets to access credit, in contrast to Aave, Compound and the like.ReSource doesn't require external lenders to provide capital for loans to be issued. Instead, the capital used to extend credit is ""spent into existence"" when members access credit, and destroyed when loans are repaid.Credit risks are securely managed by a distributed network of ""Underwriters"" who assume risk in return for staking rewardsLoans can be paid back in kind (with goods provided and services rendered)Credit decisions are based on a variety of unconventional data sets, including seller ratings on platforms like Yelp, Airbnb, Amazon, UpWork; financial data from accounting software and banks, and most uniquely, SaaS data from analytics products.Going forward, Mesh-Reputation will allow existing, rated members to vouch for new members; effectively ""staking"" their credit score to earn rewards\pay penalties respectively.  RESOURCE FINANCE PRODUCT ROADMAP  RESOURCE FINANCE REVENUE STREAMS  WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY RESOURCE FINANCE? CIP-36 is the first mutual-credit token protocol on the blockchain. CIP-36 allows users to spend into the negative according to their credit line, minting new tokens when doing so. Conversely, CIP-36 destroys tokens when negative accounts' balances are increased.A distributed, collusion-proof underwriting protocol, incentivising participants to manage credit risk rationally while securing the network's solvency.A method for wrapping credit-applicant's data as a set of ZK proofs, creating a platform-agnostic reputation system that can be selectively revealed by the user.A DID-based identity layer which allows users to carry reputation gained through interacting with the ReSource Network onto other applications.A Mutual Credit-based clearing protocol, allowing participants to settle and clear any arbitrary form of mutual obligations without relying on remittances of any kind (crypto, fiat or otherwise)A meta Mutual-Credit network, bridging different MC networks.A hybrid non-custodial key management system for retail customers to use cryptocurrency without either centralized custody nor having to be an expert in key management.

Numbers Protocol builds the new decentralized photo network for Web 3.0. With trust in digital media at an all-time low, Numbers Protocol aims to bring integrity and authenticity to the digital content space by creating a decentralized photo network where assets are both traceable and verifiable through its innovative Capture, Seal, Trace process. NUM, is the native protocol token of NUMbers Protocol. It is primarily a utility token designed to incentivize users to create, archive and verify content with good integrity. The vision of Numbers Protocol is to create an ecosystem where photos (encompassing both images and videos) matter by leveraging proofs, integrity records and data provenance to increase the credibility and legitimacy of registered photos in the network. Participants, such as verifiers and other network operators can get rewards by providing services to increase the credibility and legitimacy of registered photos. NUM tokens can also be used to pay for services running in the decentralized photo network. WHAT MAKES NUMBERS PROTOCOL UNIQUE? Since they are the only project in the Web3.0 space developing a decentralized photo network with added emphasis on authenticity, there are not any competitors yet. They envision their photo network as the Web3.0 versions of Instagram and Pinterest with emphasis on community and decentralization. Since the Capture App was launched, it has been used by users from more than 90 countries. The Seal API also passed 1M access recently and more than 3M assets have been registered to the network. WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF NUMBERS PROTOCOL? Capture App: The first blockchain camera. Users can use it to take photos with on-chain provenance. Seal API: Tools for developers to seal and retrieve photos in the network Verify website: Users can see the certificate and history of photos. NFT search engine: Help users find the NFT history associated with the photo asset and help NFT marketplaces perform theft detection CaptureClub: Native NFT marketplace for photos created via Numbers Protocol. Users can choose to list their NFT here or other marketplaces in the ecosystem NUMBERS PROTOCOL ROADMAP  NUMBERS PROTOCOL REVENUE STREAMS If users access network applications via Capture App, there is a 2% fee to the service providers. Additional revenue sources will come from native applications such as CaptureClub (NFT marketplace) and NFT search engine. The revenue will be used for network operations.  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES NUMBERS PROTOCOL USE? The decentralized photo network is built with Web3.0 storage and ledger technologies. In this network, every photo is one-of-a-kind as it has its own Web3.0 identity and can only be registered once. Registered photos in the network have associated integrity records capturing context, ownership and creator signature. Post-creation records, including any modification and change in ownership, will be appended to existing integrity records ensuring content provenance and the traceability and verifiability of all photos in the network. Data library, including Web3.0 storage and on-chain history, is the main technology used by Numbers Protocol. There are four key technologies used for creating the data library of the network: IPFS/Filecoin for content and metadata storage. The content file and the metadata file are retrieved from here.Integrity blockchain for saving integrity records. The full recorded content history is retrieved from here.Non-fungible token for recording ownership. If any ownership transfer happens, the history can be retrieved from here.Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) metadata standard for certifying the source and history of media content. This is particularly useful when the media file was not created by the network tools but other C2PA-compliant services. In that case, the provenance can be retrieved from the injections. NUMBERS PROTOCOL MARKETING STRATEGY Capture App is the first blockchain camera available on both Android and iOS platforms and is now used by users from over 90 countries. It is free for all users, and they collaborate with service providers such as news media, storage and NFT marketplaces to allow users to access Web3.0 photo ecosystem via this App. Users can use the app to take photos, archive photos to the decentralized web, mint NFTs or access other network applications. Besides the Capture App, there is also the Seal API for professional users to archive and retrieve photos to the network. They acquire users by creating vertical use cases such as 78days project (https://www.starlinglab.org/78days/) or NFT theft monitoring. NUMBERS PROTOCOL TOKEN ECONOMY The main incentive mechanisms of the network are ""Verity to earn"", ""Prove to earn"" and ""Create (photos with good integrity) to earn"".  Creators and photo asset owners participate by paying to register their photos to the network. Registered photos have their raw content archived with Web3.0 storage solutions and accompanying contextual and integrity data is stored to the blockchain. Additional contributions can come from the use of network tools such as Capture App, which automatically collects metadata, generates integrity records and creator signatures. Users who chose not to create photos with network tools can digitally sign their photos with a valid Ethereum wallet. Blockchain storage ensures the immutability and transparency of the photo content. It is important to note that Numbers Protocol values users' privacy and data rights. To that end, they take extra care to ensure that metadata that contains sensitive personal information be stored separately from non-sensitive information. Metadata that does NOT contain sensitive personal information is saved to the blockchain while the sensitive metadata is sent to decentralized storage with proper permission control.Asset retrievers can retrieve photo content and its history from the network. Since all photo assets are traceable and verifiable, it is possible to retrieve the full history and different versions of the media files. All media files can only be registered once, this helps raise the level of transparency value and credibility of photos.Retrievers can acquire a unique copy of the photo or license to use by providing payment.Payments made to the network (from acquiring copy or license) will be used to compensate the original creator of the photo and network operators. A small portion will be used to cover the operation costs of the data library. There are various network operator roles. These include storage providers, individuals who contribute to the accessibility and object permanence of registered photos in the network, and verifiers who contribute to the network by performing integrity checks and providing additional context via a professional and social trust to ensure the authenticity of photos."	6897	0.0007249528780629259	0.0001449905756125852	0.002174858634188778

32	clearpool	95000	64	DeFi	other	 Skynet Trading 	0.0	0.0	clearpool	28/10/21	ethereum	66	10	WHAT IS CLEARPOOL? Clearpool is a Decentralized Capital Markets Ecosystem, where institutional borrowers can create single borrower liquidity pools and compete for uncollateralized liquidity directly from the DeFi ecosystem. Liquidity providers on Clearpool can earn attractive yields, with pool interest rates enhanced by additional LP rewards paid in CPOOL - Clearpool's utility and governance token. Clearpool LP tokens, called cpTokens, are the building blocks for a system of tokenized credit that will provide Clearpool LPs with risk management and hedging capabilities. As more institutions begin to realize the benefits that decentralized finance can bring to their organizations, Clearpool will provide the new architecture to facilitate flows between the $120 trillion traditional capital markets, and the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. WHAT MAKES CLEARPOOL SO UNIQUE? Crypto institutions do not have the same access to financial services as their traditional peers, making it difficult to raise capital. This forces them to look at alternative sources of capital, mainly in DeFi and CeFi. DeFi protocols require collateralization, and over-collateralization has emerged as one of the major pain points for institutional borrowers in this space. CeFi platforms rely less on collateralization by reintroducing counterparty risk but provide little in the way of risk management capability for LPs. Clearpool solves these problems.  CLEARPOOL ROADMAP  CLEARPOOL REVENUE MODEL Protocol revenue will be generated from pool interest rates. A share of revenue will be used to buyback CPOOL in the open market to sustain reward pools.  HOW DOES CLEARPOOL WORK? Borrowers Borrowers on Clearpool become whitelisted through a governance process by making a proposal to the Clearpool community - CPOOL token holders. Borrowers must have completed a KYC process with a Clearpool governance accepted licensed custodian, and be staking an amount of CPOOL in order to be eligible to make a proposal. The strength of a borrower's proposal is assessed by the community, who subsequently vote to reach a consensus decision on whitelisting. Once a borrower has been whitelisted they can create and launch a liquidity pool and attract liquidity directly from the DeFi ecosystem. Clearpool liquidity pools - smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain, are continuous and borrower specific, meaning that there is only one borrower for each pool. Pool interest rates are dynamic, they rise and fall as a function of the pool utilization rate - the amount of liquidity that the borrower is currently utilizing. This dynamic interest rate mechanism will always lead to an equilibrium interest rate and pool size for each borrower, establishing the first dynamic credit market for unsecured liquidity. Liquidity Providers Anybody can be an LP on Clearpool. When connected to the Clearpool app via web3, LPs can view information on whitelisted borrowers and the details for each pool. Selecting a pool and supplying liquidity is a simple process, and when doing so, the liquidity provider will receive LP tokens called cpTokens in return. cpTokens cpTokens represent the amount of liquidity that has been supplied to a pool, accrue the pool interest rate on every block, and represent the risk profile of the borrower. cpTokens are redeemable, subject to available liquidity, and can also be traded in a secondary market, where LPs can access an additional source of liquidity and manage risk. cpTokens holders will earn additional LP incentive rewards paid in CPOOL, making Clearpool one of the most attractive venues for lending in DeFi. Thematic Pools Clearpool will also introduce Thematic Pools. Thematic Pools will allow LPs to diversify their exposure over a number of different individual pools. Thematic Pools can be created through governance and will be linked to categories of borrowers based on credit reputation scoring. TECHNOLOGIES USED CLEARPOOL Clearpool is a smart contract protocol built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart Contracts: Hardhat, Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Ethers, Unit (Mocha)Web: TypeScript, React (NextJS), Ethers, Infura / Alchemy, IPFS (Pinata) WHAT IS CLEARPOOL MARKETING STRATEGY? Clearpool has already identified and partnered with many high profile institutional borrowers - to be officially announced soon, who will open the initial liquidity pools on Clearpool. All the initial borrowers have very solid balance sheets and most of them are conducting market risk neutral strategies. These borrowers will be able to open single borrower liquidity pools and attract liquidity from both institutional lenders and individual liquidity providers in the DeFi ecosystem. Clearpool has already identified a number of institutional lenders, from both crypto native and TradFi backgrounds, who will commit capital to fuel the protocols early growth. Following the mainnet launch, Clearpool will introduce Thematic Pools - governance created liquidity pools with automated diversification and rebalancing across specific rated borrower categories. This will allow LPs to easily diversify funds across multiple pools, and allow Clearpool to build more sophisticated interest rate curves to be implemented in later versions of the protocol.

ENVOY Network helps selected partners with their creative journey in this new and thriving space, ensuring the best end-to-end services and community driven network where collectors gain rewards while doing so. 'NFT' is probably one of the hottest terms of 2021. And with celebrities, brands, musicians and IP owners worldwide starting to realize their massive potential, NFTs are changing the game on how we perceive and register ownership of assets. ENVOY offers a new thriving and exciting ecosystem driven by the ENV utility token The basic concept of an NFT is fairly simple. It's a tamper-proof certificate of ownership and authenticity. While a Bitcoin, for example, is fungible (trade one bitcoin for another and you will hold exactly the same thing in your wallet), an NFT is non-fungible. Meaning that somewhat like a traditional trading card, if you'd trade it for a different one, you'll own a completely different asset. Smart contracts can make sure all rights owners are being credited and correctly paid, even when the NFT is sold (for potentially way more money) in the secondary market, and just like with physical artwork and collectibles, the creator can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights of the work. And even though there could be millions of copies floating the internet, NFT's are designed to give the buyer something that can't be duplicated: ownership of the actual work. This is actually no different than the physical art world: anyone can buy a Picasso print, but only one person in the world can own the original. Forbes recently reported that the NFT market has boomed for almost 1800% in 2021, generating millions for digital artists and celebrities worldwide, but also functioning as a secondary income for musicians and actors in times where the pandemic forced the world to cancel all tours, concerts and movie shoots. It's worth noting that the NFT economy has only impacted a small niche of artists so far and even more importantly, it's safe to say that 99% of those artists' fan bases have remained untapped. There is still a long way to go and even the biggest platforms are struggling to broaden the spectrum, but this also means only the surface of a multi-billion-dollar market has been scratched and the potential upside is virtually infinite when a platform is finally able to tap into that full fanbase potential. That's where the ENVOY Network comes in, consisting of an extended team of industry experts, aiming to fix the current NFT issues and limitations in a multi-layer plan.

Burn two NFTs and get a superior spaceship. Merging results occur randomly - as in the real world, different results are produced each time. Each ship's blueprint holds hidden potential: appearance and different specs. $DARK token will serve as an in-game energy unit. Energy is needed to power the gameplay - travel, mine and merge NFTs. It can also be mined by claiming land on different planets. WHAT MAKES DARK FRONTIERS SO UNIQUE? Dark Frontiers is the first Gamestarter Originals game, which sets the level of quality.

Naturally, the more users will play this game and find it engaging the higher $DARK will soar. As Dark Frontiers is designed to be updated over time, it's not a one-time release, $DARK value will go up gradually. One of the main benefits of holding $DARK is that players will be able to claim land, which will freeze a certain amount of $DARK.

Orion Money's vision is to become a cross-chain stablecoin bank providing seamless and frictionless stablecoin saving, lending, and spending. Within the Orion Money stablecoin bank, There are three main products planned — Orion Saver, Orion Yield and Insurance, and Orion Pay. Orion Money is capitalizing on a significant untapped opportunity in the stablecoin savings market. The majority of stablecoin savings solutions currently offer unappealing and unpredictable yields. Additionally, they are often siloed within their individual blockchains. Interoperability will be at the heart of Orion Money, and it will bridge these gaps by providing solutions that other stablecoin savings protocols have yet to offer. The first product, Orion Saver is a cross-chain savings dApp that will provide one of the highest and most stable yields for your stablecoins, regardless of which blockchain you are on. The next product, Orion Yield and Insurance, will provide additional high-yield and insured products, bringing even more value to Orion stakers and the Orion Money depositors. As a cross-chain stablecoin bank, Orion Money will also create avenues and gateways for users to freely spend their stablecoins. This would be made possible through Orion Pay, a cross-chain payments dApp that will integrate with fiat on-off ramp solutions and allow several avenues for users to spend their stablecoins. With its suite of dApps, Orion Money offers users a convenient and frictionless way to earn high yields on their stablecoin deposits and spend them with ease — all without the hassle of moving assets across chains.  HOW UNIQUE IS ORION MONEY? As Orion Saver yield rates are already higher than of all other DeFi and CeFi savings/lending and it is just a question of time and growing awareness of Orion Money on Ethereum chain to get users to deposit their stablecoins for a higher AND fixed yield with Orion Saver. Also, as Orion Saver is a decentralized and smart contract-based - other savings protocols can integrate Orion Money as a yield source. When Orion Money is integrated into a savings solution, it becomes a win-win - the incumbent's users get Orion Saver's high yield and Orion Saver makes revenue from their deposits.  ORION MONEY ROADMAP  ORION MONEY REVENUE MODEL The Orion Money ecosystem will generate revenue from the dApps and bring value to the ORION token. Here is highlighted a list of value accrual mechanisms that they have put in place or are in the process of implementation: Orion Saver's revenue and buyback: The majority of Orion Saver's initial revenue will come from the yield differential between what Orion Money receives from Anchor Protocol and what Orion Money pays to its users. The full net revenue, after accounting for operating expenses, will be used to buy ORION tokens on the open market which would subsequently be added into the Staking Fund (see ORION token distribution chart below on Staking Fund).Orion Saver Tiered APY Staking Incentive: Orion Saver users will have to buy ORION tokens in order to increase the APY on their stablecoin deposits. The more users come to Orion Saver and deposit their stablecoins, the more ORION tokens will be bought to achieve higher APY. Consequently, the ORION token value will grow proportionally to Orion Saver's TVL growth.Conversion of stablecoin yields to ORION: When an Orion Saver user chooses to receive his/her stablecoin deposit yields in ORION tokens — Orion Money will apply the user's yield to purchase ORION tokens on the open market which would subsequently be added into the Staking Fund and paid as yield to the user.Orion Yield and Insurance Revenue: Revenue generated from the upcoming Orion Yield and Insurance product will be used to buy Orion tokens on the open market which would subsequently be added into the Staking Fund and paid to ORION Stakers.Revenue from future Orion Money dApps: As the Orion Money ecosystem grows, the revenue streams coming from future dApps in the roadmap will serve as an additional value accrual mechanism for the ORION token. Revenue earned across dApps will be used to buy ORION tokens on the open market which would be added into the Staking Fund and distributed to ORION Stakers. This aligns the incentives of token holders and the Orion Money team with the success of the Orion Money ecosystem and dApps.Orion Validator revenue and buyback: Once the Orion Validator on Terra starts charging a 5% validator commission, the net commission earned after accounting for the associated costs of running the validator, will be used to buy ORION tokens on the open market which would subsequently be added into the Staking Fund and paid to ORION Stakers.  HOW DOES ORION MONEY WORK? Orion Saver is Orion Money's native savings protocol, allowing users on other blockchain networks to easily access Anchor protocol's attractive stablecoin deposit yields without leaving their networks or performing any swaps. Orion Saver will initially focus on the Ethereum network. Users can deposit their Ethereum stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI and receive 15–25% APY depending on the amount of ORION tokens staked. Target APY levels for Orion Saver Leveraging Orion Money's native token, ORION, they have implemented incentive levels for Orion Saver depositors to increase the APY on their stablecoin deposits: Users can increase the APY on their stablecoin deposits up to 20% depending on how much they have staked ORION tokens in the Orion Saver dApp. Users who choose to receive their interest in the ORION tokens will also be able to increase their stablecoin deposit APY up to a maximum of 25%. Target APY levels on Orion Saver can be found in the table below: * APY will be lower at the initial Orion Saver launch — the APY numbers here are the target APY that they aim to achieve some time after the launch:    TECHNOLOGIES USED BY ORION MONEY Orion Money development team has built Orion Money smart contracts from the ground up themselves. Smart contracts passed already 3 audits and received great reports (Audits page). Orion Money smart contracts are coded in Solidity. The first product, Orion Saver is a cross-chain savings dApp that will provide one of the highest and most stable yields for your stablecoins, regardless of which blockchain you are on. ORION MONEY MARKETING STRATEGY Orion Money has implemented a very successful $70,000,000 Community Farming with over 700 investors, crypto projects and community members. This developed the core community and helped to scale TVL to $73m+. To continue the growth it will be onboarding: Retail investors by covering fees for the deposits and soon launching Orion Saver on PolygonCrypto projects' treasuries by integrating Gnosis safe walletsDeveloping integrations with Ethereum based DeFi and CeFi dApps (starting with a partnership with Blockbank) ORION MONEY TOKEN ECONOMY Leveraging Orion Money's native token, ORION, they have implemented incentive levels for Orion Saver depositors to increase the APY on their stablecoin deposits: Users can increase the APY on their stablecoin deposits up to 20% depending on how much they have staked ORION tokens in the Orion Saver dApp.Users who choose to receive their interest in the ORION tokens will also be able to increase their stablecoin deposit APY up to a maximum of 25%. ORION token staking ORION holders have an option to stake their ORION tokens (with a 7-day unstaking period) and receive xORION tokens as their staking proof. ORION token staking rewards will come from revenue earned across Orion Money dApps. However, the staking APY will be initially subsidized by a portion of the Orion Money Staking Fund to help kickstart the system. ORION Stakers will receive the following benefits: Governance: ORION Stakers can participate in governance activities such as the creation of proposals and voting. Proposals may include topics such as changing APY interest and tiers, community fund spending, marketing fund spending, and funding for new Orion Money dApps.Incremental Staking Yields: Staking APY for the ORION token will be calculated based on the staking duration. The longer the staking duration, the higher the staking APY would be for the ORION Staker. However, upon an un-staking event (regardless of amount), the cumulative staking APY will reset to the base rate.Preferential benefits on Orion Money dApps: ORION Stakers will get preferential terms within all Orion dApps — such as Orion Saver, Orion Yield and Insurance, Orion Pay, and future dApps.Revenue share from Orion Money dApps: ORION token Stakers will be receiving a share of Orion Money dApps' revenue. The revenue earned on dApps will be used to purchase ORION tokens from the open market which are then distributed as staking rewards to ORION Stakers in the form of xORION tokens.Revenue share from Orion Validator Commission: As mentioned in the value accrual mechanism above, the net commission earned after accounting for associated costs of running the validator, will be used to buy ORION tokens on the open market which would subsequently be added into the Staking Fund. 	9134	0.0031749507335231005	0.0002189621195533173	0.0016422158966498796

It is an aggregator of all NFT marketplaces and host the complete NFT lifecycle, allowing anyone to seamlessly create, buy, sell, swap, farm, and leverage NFTs across different blockchains. Using NFTrade, anyone can gain access to the entirety of their NFT collection, unlocking the total value of the NFT market. Currently, NFTrade is the top NFT marketplace on Avalanche and the second largest on Polygon, with growth in BSC and Ethereum usage as well. NFTRADE GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY By offering unique value-adding features such as multi-chain accessibility (with cross-chain accessibility coming soon), P2P swaps, NFT farming, and zero transaction fees for the first 6 months of operations, NFTrade can provide intrinsic value to DeFi and NFT project communities that are looking for a more interactive and community-focused platform. By integrating viable collections and projects from multiple chains, ir can introduce their communities directly to NFTrade. NFTRADE PRODUCT VIABILITY As an NFT aggregator, many of the smaller and established NFT platforms are not direct competition, as it will be able to host their NFTs for sale and swapping using NFTrade. NFTrade takes all the features missing from top marketplaces and platforms and introduces them in one easy-to-use platform. For example, escrowed NFT swapping is essentially non-existent, forcing users to trade OTC in a highly risky manner. NFTrade fixes this with trustless P2P swapping, which will eventually extend to cross-chain capabilities. Taking NFTs to a new level There is also major segmentation between blockchain networks and native NFTs, with new NFTs created across a variety of top platforms like Ethereum, BSC, Flow, Avalanche, and more. Currently, there is no way for NFT users to take advantage of the entire marketplace, with only trading on the native chain available. NFTrade expands on this problem, making it much easier to establish NFT liquidity across a much broader user base.

Numerous innovative gaming finance concepts have evolved from this model; for instance, scholarships have garnered significant attention. In the meantime, the prospects of blockchain games are immense since the whole blockchain-based in-game economy is still in its infancy and just beginning to develop its potential. 1. There is no dedicated launchpad for blockchain games that allows those interested to gain early access to qualifying games. 2. There is no game hub to explore standout blockchain game projects or valuable in-game items. 3. There is no central repository where players can easily track their earnings and manage their in-game items. 4. There is no platform that provides comprehensive game finance tools, including trading, funding, and scholarship opportunities. 5. There is no model that enables owners of game items to maximize the value of their possessions when they are not actively playing the game. Besides, concerning game studios willing to adopt blockchain, many lack the necessary technical expertise and an effective platform for reaching out to game players or token holders. That's why GameFi was created to work out these existing challenges. GameFi is an all-encompassing hub and one-stop shop for game finance, serving game studios, players, traders, and investors. GameFi will bring the gaming community the promising blockchain game initiatives developed on the BSC and Polygon networks, which host most of the top-rated play-to-earn titles. Simultaneously, GameFi is the first marketplace to enable cross-games trading of in-game items and NFTs. GameFi is strongly backed by Icetea Labs, an incubation for rising projects such as Faraland and Kaby Arena, and DAO Maker, a launchpad for numerous high-profile game projects. This collaboration is a crucial first step providing a solid foundation for the growth of GameFi's ecosystem. The ecosystem of GameFi includes 5 pillars: Launchpad, Accelerator, Aggregator, Marketplace, and Yield Guilds, Launchpad. Each part has its own core features, innovations, and improvements that are solid pillars for the ecosystem to grow and benefit the user community. GAMEFI GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY The first part of the GameFi ecosystem to be released is GameFi Launchpad. This is a game-dedicated launchpad released for conducting the first IGO (Initial Game Offering), starting with Kaby Arena and DeathRoad. Most importantly, GameFi collaborates closely with Icetea Labs, DAO Maker, Animoca Brands, and other reputable partners to grow and diversify the GameFi game community, which includes a large network of game projects. additionally contributes to the growth of IGO activities, in-game item marketplaces, and production guilds. The project also has a strong team of KOLs, ambassadors, and influencers not only in the blockchain community but also in the gaming community with the mission of bringing GameFi closer to everyone, especially the gaming enthusiasts. GAMEFI PRODUCT VIABILITY GameFi's competitors are a few other yield guilds and game-dedicated launchpads on the market. However, it is unique in providing all-in-one solutions, including an aggregator for tracking earnings and discovering great games, a launchpad for games, yield guilds, a marketplace, and an accelerator. The project is supported by Icetea Labs, Dao Maker, and Polygon, all of whom have previously supported multiple games, providing GameFi with a strong foundation to build on.

A kill-or-be-killed adrenaline-charged multiplayer game that is pioneering NFT game characters. That means players' performance directly affects the value of your NFT - in other words, if you play an awesome game, you'll make a killing. Snook is an online, multiplayer, ""Snake""-like IO game. It's riding the fastest growing trend in this segment - the ""Play-to-Earn"" NFT game model. -OK, so this is hot! Great. But what is it? The player's snook-character in the game is a minted NFT. As the player advances in the game (by eating everything it can, avoiding and killing other snooks and taking their traits), he accrues achievements (e.g., traits and rare/difficult-to-get special skins). Blockchain and Crypto technologies make it possible for us to immutably record these achievements (think of it as a Blockchain/Crypto ""barrel""). The game character/NFT can be accessed in future games or for commercial purposes, and - under certain conditions - provides financial incentives to the player. This merger between a new, decentralized, trust-agnostic, and immutable economic paradigm and one of the most popular pass-times in Human history (gaming), is surprisingly natural and seamless. Players spend time playing. They develop skills with patience and persistence. Until today, their efforts were measured by their score, ranking and/or character evolution. Rewards were emotional and social – it felt good, and players got ""street cred"" from the relevant community. However, like all economies, if one invests work in something, it should be possible to exchange the ""fruits"" of that labor for other things that store value. Those could be money (e.g., Fiat or FT/cryptocurrencies), commodities (which are still fungible, i.e., replacing one with another does not affect their value) or non-fungible items (i.e. NFTs). This leads us back to Snook – a game that allows players to capture their unique gaming achievements in their NFT. Furthermore, Snook makes certain achievements especially difficult to realize, allowing exceptional players to make their NFTs rare and therefore increase their value. Think of Snook as a crypto meritocracy - an equivalent to that thing your parents used to say: 'if you work hard and apply yourself, you'll reap the benefits of your labour'… Aside from the monetization of skill, Snook is a demonstration of a new NFT value-setting mechanism we call SVM - Skill-based Value Metric. It ties rarity and value to effort, talent and skill. The rapid inflation of the NFT market is fueled by buzz and FOMO, which means we're risking a so-called ""bubble"". The only way to mitigate that risk is by maturing the market and developing objective metrics for setting an objective value for NFTs. Snook demonstrates this possibility in practice and sets a robust precedent in that regard. Snook has raised $1.65M USD from private investors in the first half of 2021. It is set to launch on the mainnet and complete its funding (private and public) on August 21. WHAT IS SNOOK'S GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY?  WHAT IS SNOOK'S PRODUCT VIABILITY? Raison d'etre Snook is tapping into multiple super hot emerging trends. The first is the exploding Casual/Hyper-casual gaming segment. Numbers estimating the size and growth rate of this segment vary widely, depending on source. What is clear is that they already crossed the 60% of Mobile users with double digit growth rate. Snook is not currently offering a mobile dedicated version of the game (although it is possible to play it on mobile phone). Nevertheless, Android and IOS are integral to the Product roadmap. This Desktop-first approach is inline with the strategy to first recruit the innovators and early-adopters before stimulating demand in the mass market. The second is the ""Play-to-Earn"" trend. Well-substantiated stats are difficult to come by, however there is mounting evidence that the earning option of Casual gaming is a quite effective incentive and probably responsible for the accelerating growth of this segment. In other words, players are looking to monetize their gaming habits.  The third is the gamification of NFTs. Snook is at the focal point of all three trends. Differentiators Market approach Commercial potential equals Broad Appeal. Snook is simple and easy to play, which is why it is appealing to everyone. At the same time, it's a live multiplayer arena and provides strong financial incentives. It provides an experience that is orders of magnitude more exciting than playing candy crush on your own. This is a key factor, as Snook is aiming for broad mass-market adoption.An esport arena. Snook happens in an arena. It focuses on creating a dedicated core kadre of players that will play Snook professionally, just like other e-sports. This type of core professional appeal is the key for massive expansion. All super-successful games, virtual or physical, have this core of professional gamers, which acts like a center of gravity for attracting additional fans and players.Sustainable tokenomics design. Snook's token-economy is designed to keep it going. Like that famous joke about the two bees - one young one old - seeing a field of flowers below. The younger bee says ""Let's fly as fast as we can and suck the nectar of one of these flowers"". The older bee says: ""Let's take out time, and suck all of them"". That's why 98% of internal revenue is channeled back to the users and why good players that were able to get special skins are rewarded on a regular basis (keeping them in the game and not sending them out to sell their NFTs). In the end, Snook will become a full DAO.Stable economy. Snook has a built-in anti-inflation mechanism. It actually should not be called that. It should be called ""common-sensical"" or ""a mechanism based on rudimentary understanding of economics"". $SNKs used to mint a new snook-NFT are burned, meaning the value of the $SNK was ""transferred"" into the NFT. Snook is different because of SVM (Skill-based Value Metric) There is no other game that directly competes with it. There are great games out there, but none have the winning combination of traits that Snook offers. First, and this should be enough, none of them have the SVM - a revolutionary technology that determines the face-value of NFTs based on measurable attributes and objective rarity. Secondly, good NFT games, and gamified NFT apps, all seem to suffer from unforced and annoying features. They are either too complex, or have other fun-destroying features such as Pay2Win. Some of them are just not very exciting - plain and simple. It's an actual NFT game - not NFT-infused or gamified NFT. There are a few successful NFT-infused games in the market. Snook differs from them in two key ways:  1) Not NFT-infused. It's not a game with collectible NFT assets in it. The player's character IS the NFT. When a snook is extracted it's an actual true-record of ones game-state, reflecting the effort and skill invested by the player. Why does this matter? It matters because of the valuation of the NFT. When rarity - and therefore value - are set centrally and arbitrarily, they do not reflect a true economic relationship between value and intrinsic value (that stems from work, talent, and skill). 2) Not a gamified NFT. There are also NFT generators that have added gamification elements to them. This is not exciting and there isn't much else to say on the matter.Fair Play - An Even Playing-field. Snook is not a Pay2Win game. Skill is all that matters. If you're not good enough, play some more and get better. There are no special upgrades players can buy for money that give them any kind of advantage. Motivation for playing Some people play games for fun. Some play to win. Only few play professionally to make money. Snook unites all these reasons into one game. People can play for fun, to win, AND to make money. The problem is that only few will really be good enough to make a lot of money. It's not a big problem – because today no one makes money – so what's the worst that can happen, the player has fun. But still, for Snook to work, people need to believe that they can monetize their skills. Below, we elaborate on this pseudo-problem and present the rationale fro the underlying viability of Snook as a popular mass-market game. Few players are really good but hey, there's the Dunning-Kruger effect In any skill-based activity, especially games, some people are better than others. It's a combination of talent and practice. The distribution of ""ranking"" is bell-shaped and symmetric. However, games that include a monetary incentive, such as tournaments with prize-money and - as in Snook's case - an NFT financial environment, the ""ranking"" distribution becomes skewed. This means that few players are good enough to win significant incentivizes. That's both because there's an added layer of stress on the players that ""thins the herd"" (leaving behind players that buckle under pressure) and because the payout for uniqueness and scarcity in an NFT market is not linear. These two elements lead us to assume that in Snook only few people will make enough money to rationally justify the effort; some people will make some money, and most will not make any. This likely reality may sound like a deterrence to playing the game. This is where the Dunning-Kruger effect comes into play. The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with low aptitude tend to overestimate their ability. This stems both from their overconfidence in their ability and from a misperception of the skills and abilities of others. Either way, you'll play because: 1) you think you belong to the group that is good enough to be appropriately rewarded, and 2) there's no way of telling if you are right or if you are a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Problem solved. WHAT IS SNOOK'S ROADMAP?  WHAT IS SNOOK'S PRODUCT DIVE?  To start playing, the user mints a new Snook NFT, which comes with a random Trait. Traits are Colors, Patterns and/or SWAG and they affect the Snook's appearance. Here are a few examples:  The game is all about ""Eat & Avoid"". The player's Snook is introduced to the game-map and the player controls its direction and speed. It eats orbs to get bigger and longer. Those are spread randomly on the game-map and are also dropped when a Snook dies (if it hits another snook or the game's outer wall). If a snook dies there's a good probability that it will drop its traits - which is how other Snooks get their traits. Special Skins Consuming Traits gives the Snook its value, because it is how a player can unlock Special Skins. Each Special Skin is unlocked once a Snook consumed a specific combination of Traits. Here are a few examples:  Extraction At the edge of the game-Map there's a strip that is called the ""Extraction Zone"". In it there are Extraction Points. They are circular and portal-like. If a snooks passes through them, it can leave the game while keeping its traits and special skins. Resurrection Snook can be a highly rewarding, but also a quite unforgiving game. Players may play for a long time, increasing their Snook in size and collecting Traits and Special Skins, all to suddenly die because of a momentary loss of focus. The resurrection feature deals with this harsh fact of life. When a Snook dies in-game, its NFT is burned. Alternatively, a player can decide to keep it, i.e., resurrect it for a fee, keeping most of its attributes. The fee is proportional to the number of traits it had at the moment of death. The more traits it had, the higher the cost of resurrection. In addition, each resurrected Snook will lose one or more of its traits. The number of Traits lost will depend on the number of times it was resurrected (one for the first time, two for the second, and so on). The Traits it loses are selected at random. Tournament Mode - The Gladiators' Arena Participation in a tournament is open to anyone that possesses and deposits a tournament pass (which is an NFT minted by the Snook system). Each month the Snook system will mint a set number of passes and then allocate them according to the following guidelines: - Top players: 40% will be allocated to Snook owners (if you have snook NFTs is your wallet, that's you) with the highest in-game score - Up-and-Coming: 30% will be allocated at random to any Snook owner that has at least one Special Skin. - Stakers Rock: 30% will be allocated to Snook active stakers. (If you're are or aren't, you aren't.) If you are eligible for a tournament pass, and/or got selected at random, the system will automatically mint the pass and transfer it to your wallet. Tournament passes are tradeable NFTs. Giving them away or selling them is at your discretion. If there aren't enough people in groups #2 or #3, the system will increase the allocation to group #1. Tournament prizes The total prize pool is up to 12% of the total Treasury standings, at the moment of Tournament Match starts. The prize pool is relative: the ratio of invited players to the tournament to the actual participants. Challenge Mode A Snook Challenge is a 1-on-1 PvP mode that provides an awesome way to demonstrate a player's skill by crushing an opponent and also win very cool prizes (most of which are impossible get in normal play mode). There are several types of challenges one can engage in. For example there is the Big Boys Table (BBT) In this type of challenge a player creates a private 1-on-1 game or joins one created by someone else. When creating a BBT, the player is asked to allocate collateral in $SNK tokens and also pay fee (2.5% of the collateral). To join a BBT, another player has to match the collateral and pay the fee. The winner takes both collaterals. WHAT ARE SNOOK'S REVENUE STREAMS? 98% of Snook's fees are reinvested in the gamer-community. 1.75% of the treasury to be allocated as a revenue stream to the company every month. Limited edition special skins sale in a later stage of the roadmap [those won't give any in-game advantage to the holders. Snook is not a Pay2Win game] The implication is that >98% of Snook's fees are reinvested in the gamer-community. This is how you grow a gamer-crowd. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED AND CREATED BY SNOOK? First the ""dry"" facts. Snook is built on Unity. It has a relatively high TPS (10,000) and uses Polygon (previously Matic) as its blockchain layer. It is an Ethereum side-chain (L2) which means it has better scalability, among other advantages. This fact also allows us to pay the gas fees for every Snook transaction and therefore deliver seamless experience for both crypto veterans and mass-market new-adopters. Most importantly, Snook is the realization of a dramatic innovation and technological concept - the Skill-based Value Metric, or SVM. As mentioned above, Snook's ""news to the world"" is the ability to use blockchain to fuse together effort, talent and skill with intrinsic scarcity, i.e., the face-value of the NFT. To do this all game-states in Snook are done On-chain. Yes, every GAME STATE. As the player accrues in-game achievements, they are recorded immutably on the blockchain and continuously set the rarity of the NFT. The SVM is a new use of blockchain technology that defines the scarcity, and therefore the face-value of a crypto-asset. WHAT IS A TOKEN ECONOMY OF SNOOK? To play Snook, gamers use an ERC20 token called $SNK to mint their NFT/snook. Once minted the $SNK tokens are burned, which acts as an anti-inflation mechanism. Think about it, the value of the $SNK was ""transferred"" into the NFT; keeping it will be the same as printing money. Our players are super-focused and applies all their skills and talents to collect a number of Traits and Special Skin to add to their personal Snook NFT. That way the Snook economy is inseparable from the actual gameplay. Moreover, this intrinsic incentive will foster a healthy active user base and its growth rate. Tokens The Snook economy is based on two token protocols: ERC20 for the $SNK token and ERC721 for the Snook-NFT. $SNK $SNK is issued on Ethereum L2 (Polygon, previously Matic) and later in the roadmap on L1 with PoS bridge. As mentioned $SNKs used to mint Snooks are burned (lowering the total supply). Attention: We will not mint any additional $SNK tokens. In addition to their utility in minting the Snooks, $SNK tokens are also used for fees, such as the Resurrection fee and for Rewards such as prizes or Staking. Treasury The Treasury's source of funds are the user-community and 98.25% of it is invested back in the community in the form of Rewards. Sources of Treasury revenues are: - Snook Resurrections - Secondary Market Trades - Initial $SNK token Allocation The Treasury funds: - Special Skin rewards - Staking rewards - Tournaments Prize Pool Due to the fact that some funding channels are planned for a later stage of the Roadmap, we want to keep the players driven and the game's incentives solid from the first day. In this regard, we have allocated Special Funds from the total supply. The allocation is vested and will be unlocked every two months, starting high and decreasing over time, as we expect to finish all funding channels and a higher user adoption in the meantime. Every month 1.75% of the treasury are to be allocated to the Snook foundation in order to cover monthly expenses and contingencies. Rewards are beings distributed from the treasury as $SNK tokens "	17508	0.0006282842129312315	0.0	0.00028558373315055975

From beloved film franchises to celebrities and sport heroes, Chronicle is building a studio and marketplace app for authenticated digital collectibles, more commonly known as NFT's. Tim Glover — best known for his work involving digital online fan experiences for Jurassic World (2015) and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) — has co-founded the global project alongside Jim Jin —early investor and advisor to Thorchain — who brings several years of blockchain advisory and business experience to Chronicle. ""With Chronicle we're building a platform for fans of beloved brands — user friendly, easy onboarding, no blockchain know-how."" Tim explains. ""Something we know that works for the studios and their fans, making digital collectibles accessible to millions."" ""With Jurassic World we worked closely with the film creators and studio to create a series of unique digital experiences that were focused on the fans. We're taking those same principals to create a series of immersive digital experiences — something we know from experience the studios can endorse and be a part of."" The team already boasts an exciting team of talented individuals across the entertainment and business world — including creative directors Jack Anthony Ewins (UK) and Manuel Bejarano (Spain) who worked on the Jurassic World digital fan campaigns with Universal — and Los Angeles-based Doug Neil, former Executive Vice President of Digital Marketing at Universal Pictures, who joins Chronicle in an Executive-level role. ""Doug oversaw, led and shaped the film studio's online and mobile marketing for the last decade in an ever adapting digital world. To have someone like him with his experience and over 200 film titles to his name, on the ground in LA, opens doors that otherwise would have been less accessible."" With office locations being established across the United States, United Kingdom, China, Singapore, Eastern Europe, and Australia — Chronicle is positioning itself to scale into becoming the world's first truly global NFT company. Fellow Chronicle co-founder Jim Jin additionally presents a bullish case for Chronicle's native smart token — XNL. ""XNL allows us to create a fan-led economy inside Chronicle's ecosystem where users are rewarded for holding our native token"" Jim added. ""Use cases include premium access to limited edition collectibles, store discounts, community governance, rewards, and more."" The Chronicle community can expect a series of announcements to be made over the next few weeks with regards to details surrounding high-profile Seed and Private Sale VC partners. Further details on Chronicle's community-focused Public Sale will be made in due course. ABOUT CHRONICLE Chronicle App Features: Easy email sign up. No cryptography. No private keys. No lost collectibles.USD onboarding via payment integration partners (e.g. Stripe, Paypal).Premium, authenticated digital collectibles backed by the world's greatest brands.Buy, sell, swap/trade, bid, and gift opportunities for collectibles.Social media integration to display and show off collectibles.Gamification — build a moat for fan engagement to drive repeat visits and customization of Chronicle profiles.Rewards (XNL) which can be used for trade discounts and priority access to limited edition collectibles.Seamless user experience. Each user account receives a linked wallet for their collectibles accessible by both web and mobile app. All the blockchain and complexity is behind the scenes, resulting in the onboarding of average users with no desire to learn about ""crypto"". WHAT IS CHRONICLE'S GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY? Traditional / fan-focusedCryptoIn-app growth Chronicle intends on collaborating with studios and fan networks to promote and distribute digital collectibles after IP has successfully been onboarded. This was successfully achieved during the 2014-15 Jurassic World digital marketing campaign for ""Masrani Global"" when Tim, Jack, Manuel and Doug (Universal Pictures) created an immersive fan experience focussed on Jurassic Park fans which saw the film make $1.7B US at the US domestic and international box office. The process was repeated again in 2017-18 for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom through the ""Dinosaur Protection Group"" which saw the studio collect US$1.31B in ticket sales. In the example of Jurassic World, Chronicle has already established a partnership with the Jurassic Outpost fan network (jurassicoutpost.com) run by Jack De La Mare and Chris Pugh which has a collective social and web audience of over half a million regular fans. They are also looking at in-app opportunities such as giveaways, competitions and growth-hacks to onboard and scale the user base over time. Additionally, they will look to traditional digital marketing methods and PR to raise awareness of the Chronicle platform and onboard users whilst at the same time looking to engage with crypto influencers and KOLs with large networks for the initial promotion of the Chronicle platform amongst the crypto community. CHRONICLE PRODUCT VIABILITY 1. Fan Focused Fans are at the heart of Chronicle's mission. They have a track record of partnering with fan communities to create immersive digital experiences. Unlike other existing NFT platforms that seek to only target the crypto community, Chronicle is the first app created uniquely for fans that leverages fan networks through traditional digital marketing methods. Where crypto NFT platforms target numbers in the hundreds, Chronicle digital collectibles seek to target fan numbers in the millions. 2. Studio and Film Franchise Experience They understand and respect the dynamics of working with premium movie brands and franchises and the importance of protecting the filmmaker and creator's vision. They have done this before, many times.  CHRONICLE PRODUCT ROADMAP  CHRONICLE REVENUE STREAMS Given the nature of Chronicle being a fan-focused platform and being licensed directly from official brands, the revenue of Chronicle can come from primary, secondary and business sales, including but not limited to the following: Direct Sales from Chronicle Store (First Market Revenue). After acquiring official licenses from brands, Chronicle will work closely with the creative team of the brand owners to create officially licensed NFTs. These NFTs will be issued and sold to the fans in forms of common drops, mystery boxes, etc. Chronicle shares a royalty with the brand owner from the revenue generated from the sales of each collectible.Premium Listings & Auctions (First Market Revenue). There are limited-edition collectibles from the brand which are sold in forms of premium listing or auction. Similar to direct sales, Chronicle will share a royalty with the brand owner from the revenue generated from the sale of each collectible.Transaction Fees from Chronicle Marketplace (Secondary Market Revenue). Chronicle takes a 5% commission from all sold collectibles on the secondary marketplace, with the remaining 95% going to the seller. This fee covers the operational cost (e.g. blockchain fees) and includes a small royalty shared between Chronicle and the brand owner.NFT as a Service (NaaS, B2B Revenue). As Chronicle develops and onboards more brands, its authority in helping brands connect with fans using digital collectibles in a professional and creative way will be enhanced. Thus, Chronicle can serve as a creative consulting company offering NFT as a Service offerings. It is highly likely that these services could expand beyond Chronicle's own Store and Marketplace to external NFT partners. CHRONICLE PRODUCT DIVE Chronicle Store The issuance and distribution center for authenticated digital collectibles. All licensed collectibles are categorized in collections which are sold in limited edition sets per period of time (e.g. week, fortnight, month). The forms of the sales are divided into: NFT DropsNFT Mystery BoxesNFT Auctions All purchases across NFT Drops, NFT Mystery Boxes, and NFT Auctions shall be made via USD (fiat or stablecoins) that is pre-loaded into the user's Chronicle account. NFT Drops An NFT Drop is the sale of a series of minted collectibles on the Chronicle Store available until they are sold out. Different quantities of collectibles will be minted and sold under a collection, with different price points based on their rarities. The quantity of a collectible is fixed. Collectibles can be scheduled to drop across a period of time, or launched all at once. Users will be able to purchase freely once a drop is activated. NFT Mystery Boxes Unlike an NFT Drop where the purchaser knows exactly what collectible they are acquiring at purchase, Chronicle also seeks to issue Mystery Boxes based on random selection. A collection with varying quantities of different collectibles within a brand and/or franchise can be issued where the user doesn't know exactly what collectible they will receive until the point after it is purchased. An example of a mystery box could include a set of 10 unique superhero characters in various quantities across Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary. The user would purchase the Mystery Box, at which point their collectible would be revealed. Chronicle will ensure users will know beforehand what collectibles can be obtained from a Mystery Box purchase, including the quantity of collectibles and their rarity, as well as how many Mystery Boxes remain available for purchase. NFT Premium Auctions Chronicle will issue exclusive digital collectibles and make them available via an auction. The rarity of collectibles via the Premium Auction method will all be ""Immortal"" status (i.e. ""one of a kind""). Chronicle applies the basic auction model where parameters are set around the auction, including: Auction type (e.g. English, Dutch, Vickery, etc.)Starting priceMinimum standing time for the highest bidAuction durationParticipation requirements Chronicle Marketplace Central to its platform, Chronicle's collectible marketplace allows users to buy, sell, swap, trade, bid, and gift licensed digital collectibles from leading brands. Listing of a collectible for sale, swap, or trade is free; as is gifting a collectible.Once a buyer takes an order, 5% of the deal price will be charged from the seller. This fee covers the operational cost (e.g. blockchain fees) and includes a small royalty shared between Chronicle and the brand owner. All purchases shall be made in USD (fiat or stablecoins). WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY CHRONICLE? Chronicle sees itself as a media company rather than a technology company. They are building a custom designed platform for Web/Desktop and iOS/Android where users will be able to register and purchase/trade digital collectibles from beloved brands across the world. All blockchain complexity is handled by Chronicle. WHAT IS THE CHRONICLE TOKEN ECONOMY? "	10849	0.0002765231818600793	0.0004608719697667988	0.0012904415153470366

Here, every DeFi function is climate positive at no extra cost for the user. Users can make, own, and trade the positive impact they make by using Brokoli's green DeFi products. Brokoli's core platform: a green aggregator for token swaps, lending and yield farming. It makes every DeFi transaction climate positive at no extra cost for the user. API: Any GameFi and DeFi platform can implement the Brokoli API to make their transactions climate positive, generating more revenue, brand awareness and users for Brokoli. NFT Digital Forests: Users can receive seeds by using Brokoli's green products or by completing quests. These seeds are turned into NFT trees after the DAO vote. Digital NFT forests will be tradable as Brokoli Impact Credits with other users that want to move up the leaderboard of impact, and with corporates that want CSR (corporate social responsibility) - it's a decentralized alternative to carbon credits. Governing the protocol is the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model that controls 100% of the climate offset funding, with the BRKL token at its core. This mechanism distributes the funds collected between Tree Planting, Renewable Energy and Electronic Waste Collection projects around the globe, with token holders having 100% control of the fund allocations. WHAT MAKES BROKOLI UNIQUE?  DeFi and the blockchain community in general is experiencing scrutiny from the media and the wider public about the sustainability concerns to be addressed before any wider adoption can be achieved. In addition, there is a rise in sustainability-conscious platforms that are looking to find ways to offset their footprint. Simultaneously there is a lack of transparency and accountability associated with DeFi and digital assets, which makes many platforms less trustworthy. 87% of Gen Zers are concerned about the environment, including 90% of Gen Zers who think companies must lead the way in the planet's sustainability journey. Similarly, more than 70% of millennials care about global warming and other climate issues. 42% of millennials are planning to enter the crypto ecosystem, which means that the space will be forced to find long-term sustainability solutions like Brokoli. Climate offsetting solutions already exist, and have displayed great demand. For example, Chooose, a digital API solution that gives airline companies the ability to offer carbon offsets for their passengers at checkout and boasts clients like Wizzair, Lonely Planet, Norwegian Airlines, SkyScanner, Santander. #Teamtrees demonstrates that people are keen on sharing their impact, with Elon Musk, Mark Benioff and Plants vs Zombies competing dollar-to-dollar for the crown of someone who's planted the most trees. While there is great demand for green solutions in crypto, green products alone may not achieve adoption. That's why Brokoli's users will not only make an impact, but also will sell their impact to others in the form of NFT trees. For the first time ever, your positive impact is a tangible asset and not just something that makes you feel good. Brokoli will enter the market as the first play-to-earn NFT metaverse where impact is money. Therefore, there is no direct competition and Brokoli has the first-mover's advantage. BROKOLI ROADMAP  BROKOLI REVENUE STREAMS  HOW DOES BROKOLI WORK? Digital Forest: Play-to-Earn NFTs for Planting Trees We will introduce elements of Play-to-Earn by issuing digital trees (comprising forests) as fractionalized NFTs, enabling users to own their impact. Digital Forests will function as a tradable asset, whereby users will be able to buy and sell their impact peer-to-peer or to a third party (companies, NGOs, influencers). Read how it works.  The First Climate-Positive DEX Aggregator Brokoli's DEX Aggregator enables carbon offsets to be part of every token swap without damaging user experience. The DEX Aggregator builds upon the more capital efficient model of trading enabled by Uniswap v3. Users select slippage fees, and any excess slippage is used for climate positive action: renewable energy projects, planting trees, waste collection and recycling. See Demo here: https://brokoli.network/  API Integration With our seamless integration, crypto platforms will get our all-in-one climate toolkit - software equipped to offer their customers climate offset options at check-out, in-app, or anywhere they meet their customers. With 1-click, a user on any digital asset marketplace, exchange, or a wallet will be able to make their transfer climate positive. Read how it works.  Transparent climate dashboard that monitors Brokoli's impact Users see real-time impact in trees planted, carbon emissions reduced, and fund allocations. They see the total amount of funds distributed to climate change offsets, have the ability to track revenue sources from Brokoli's ecosystem and trace where the funds were distributed. Upon login, users see their individual impact and can claim their green NFT reward to share their impact. Decentralized offsetting platform There are three causes that will receive the funds from every Climate Fee payment: Trees planted for carbon footprint offsettingRenewable energy project investments in developing countriesFinancing e-waste collection and recycling programmes  TECHNOLOGIES USED AND CREATED BY BROKOLI The project is being built using Smart Contracts (Solidity) and deployed on Ethereum Network. Later it will be expanded to other EVM-compatible networks such as Binance Smart Chain and Polygon. Fees and contracts will be audited and secured using Hardware Wallets and/or multisig wallets. Decentralized and proovable solutions will be used to ensure randomness when generating NFTs and asset price when calculating impact. Tokens and NFTs are all either ERC20 or ERC-721 compliant. In the future ERC-1155 standard can be used to better serve the use cases. BROKOLI MARKETING STRATEGY Stage 1. Partnerships Brokoli partners with DeFi and GameFi projects that integrate Brokoli's green API and bring brand awareness, users and revenue. Stage 2. NFT Collection Brokoli's NFTs capitalize on the popularity of digital art but adds a twist to it: every NFT is a symbol for individual positive impact. It's a decentralised alternative of carbon credits. Stage 3. Cashbacks + Play-to-Earn Brokoli's tokenomics compensate active community members in these three areas: - project ambassadors - DAO governance participants - products users Users can also make money by selling their impact.

The company processed €1.25 billion worth of crypto in 2020 and €1.8 billion in 2021 so far. The CoinsPaid ecosystem includes financial crypto products like a payment gateway that processes 5% of all on-chain BTC transactions with more than 700,000 BTC transactions in a month, enterprise and personal wallets with a built-in crypto exchange, an OTC desk, and a SaaS payment gateway. Their next goal is to bridge the gap between business and DeFi services and expand their presence in the B2C market. Now they are working on the launch of the CPD token and DeFi tools, which will be integrated into each service and product of the CoinsPaid ecosystem. COINSPAID MARKETING STRATEGY First and foremost CoinsPaid is a B2B company that works with merchants and companies that utilize cryptocurrency payments. Such clients already number more than 700 and they will certainly become one of the first users of the CPD. Furthermore, CoinsPaid adds different discounts on all operations in the ecosystem to motivate using the token more often. They also work on the collaboration strategy with their merchants to use CPD as their main payment tool. Their B2B clients also have 5+ mln end users, which can be involved in using new DeFi tools within the ecosystem. CoinsPaid's tokenomics also involves extra bonuses and discounts for the B2C audience, even a loyalty program for affiliates. CoinsPaid plans on full adoption of B2C direction by using their soon-to-be-implemented DeFi resources. So one of the reasons for the IDO launch is about gaining traction within the DeFi community. Their future tools will allow their current partners to implement effective decentralized solutions and the new customers to enter CoinsPaid. WHAT MAKES COINSPAID UNIQUE? CoinsPaid's main advantage against competitors is the versatility of its business model. While others are usually focusing on one product that is already successful and growing steadily, CoinsPaid is constantly looking for new solutions that will attract additional customers. Currently, the company is looking to enter a B2C segment by releasing DeFi solutions for both current B2B clients and future retail users and investors. CoinsPaid's main competitor for 1st place as a payment gateway is CoinPayments that are mainly focusing on one product — cryptocurrency payment servicing. CoinsPaid is more interested in expanding the current ecosystem which already includes multiple B2B solutions. They grew over 5 times and processed over a billion euros worth of crypto payments only in 2020.  COINSPAID PRODUCT ROADMAP  COINSPAID REVENUE STREAMS   HOW DOES COINSPAID WORK? CoinsPaid Token (CPD) is the utility token of the CoinsPaid ecosystem. The CPD token will link on-chain and off-chain products, ensuring a smooth transfer of value across the ecosystem. CPD will be integrated into each service and product of the CoinsPaid ecosystem as a payment, rewarding, or discount means. Until the end of the year, CoinsPaid will develop additional functionality and add more use cases to the CPD token, including staking, loyalty rewards for affiliates, and bridge protocol for swaps and asset control via multiple chains. To guide users through new services and DeFi solutions, CoinsPaid Academy will be launched. It aims to drive crypto adoption in the masses and educate users about disrupting services driven by DeFi. In addition, CoinsPaid will release its own DeFi dashboard in Q1 2022. The dashboard will integrate popular decentralized solutions and tools. The most valuable product of the company at this point is the payment gateway. It accepts more than 50 crypto and fiat currencies from end-users around the world. CoinsPaid payment gateway allows businesses to achieve full global coverage and will help to save up to 90% on the fees against traditional payment systems. In Q3 and Q4 of 2021, it will receive additional plugins for eCommerce, widgets for PoS, and add off-chain transactions with 0 mining fees for users of the personal wallet. One of the first CoinsPaid B2C solutions is the personal multi-currency crypto wallet that includes a built-in crypto exchange with more than 20 fiat currency pairs and bank card support that's coming soon. COINSPAID TOKEN ECONOMY The CPD token is a means of value transfer like BTC, ETH, or USDT, but instantly and at a lower cost. With the token being the fuel for new DeFi services on CoinsPaid, its functionality won't be limited by payments only. CoinsPaid plans to enable such utility functions as: Paying commissions in CPD. CoinsPaid users will be able to get up to 50% discount on all operations in the ecosystem both for B2B and B2C solutions – 30% discount on operations for CPD staking and an additional 20% discount for paying fees in CPD tokens.Staking. CoinsPaid users will be able to stake CPD. The reward will depend on the amount staked, category of user (business or individual), as well as locking period.Loyalty rewards in CPD. The incentives for B2B product resellers will earn up to 20% of lifetime commissions from resold merchants. B2C CoinsPaid wallet affiliates will get up to 50% of revenue share.Liquidity pools. CoinsPaid holders will be able to provide liquidity in CPD and earn additional APY.Service payments. CPD token will be the main means of payment for the PR in CoinsPaid Academy and Marketing services from the CoinsPaid team.	5455	0.0018331805682859762	0.00036663611365719525	0.0016498625114573786

DinoX is formed by a group of tech-savvy individuals with a major interest in blockchain technology, gaming, crypto, and at the same time with a major passion for dinosaurs. The team seeks to build a complex NFT gaming experience for collectors and players. They're creating a game that is a mix of popular genres for both desktop and handheld devices. Set on the Islands of DINOX World, you will find yourself surrounded by various packs of living dinosaurs. The catch and core idea is that they live on the blockchain and you can digitally own them, take care of them, breed them, train them, and fight different creatures occupying the islands. Easy to learn how to play, but with a more complex game design to satisfy different player skill levels. Eight thousand Dino eggs will be available to be farmed via the staking features when the MVP is released in the coming weeks. DINOX MARKETING STRATEGY DinoX's go to market strategy is based on giving players rewards as early as possible to drive engagement. The rewards are going to be mostly wrapped around dinos themselves and utilities for them. This way it can bring users into the ecosystem very easily as they emphasize the play-to-earn model. After the public sale and launch of the project, DinoX will gradually bring in all the features of the game itself, the first being available during launch. The first phase - the standard environment for dinos will be available, i.e. an Earth-like setting. The second phase - new environment and ""worlds"" shall be added, such as an underwater world, sky world, martian world, etc. The development of future environments shall be influenced by the community through governance and popularity preference. The team will be communicating with the community to receive feedback, inspiration and preference as to which game development aspect to explore further. WHAT MAKES DINOX UNIQUE? The blockchain gaming industry has a total market size of $68 billion, with a year over year growth of 9.8% The primary target group of the game are men & women aged 15-40, with a nostalgic incentive to people who had a childhood filled with dinosaurs, as many of us did. Their plan is to aim the target as wide as possible and bring some new people into blockchain technology by providing them with an easy and enjoyable first experience. So the audience is potentially overlapping between the first group mentioned and people with some experience with blockchain who might want to utilize new technology in a brand new game. Overall experience with their product should be really focused on high-quality gameplay and fun, this solves a current issue with blockchain games, as their gameplay lacks quality.  DINOX PRODUCT ROADMAP  DINOX REVENUE STREAMS Game / Games within the ecosystem where the DNXC token is used for such transactions (and lower rates apply if people use DNXC tokens). There is also going to be a fiat gateway to purchase special items and other stuff within the game. Users can buy dinosaurs or dinosaur eggs, land, special clothes and items to boost their gameplay all using DNXC tokens. In later stages, they will also implement a fiat gateway for non-crypto users. Potentially, there will be revenue coming from merchandise, physical NFTs and auctions of special NFTs for fans and the DinoX community. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY DINOX?

DeRace is a play-to-earn NFT horse racing metaverse where you can participate in horse races, breed NFT horses with unique characteristics, host races in your own NFT hippodrome and earn profit while doing it. DeRace is electrifying the current NFT market by allowing players to fully interact with their DNA-enriched NFT horses and have full control of their own hippodromes. Blockchain technology allows transparent horse racing outcomes which makes stakes on the DeRace platform reliable and safe. DeRace platform economy will run on $DERC token, which will power all transactions (entry fees, prizes, NFT sales, player earnings, etc) made on the platform including referral bonuses and reward programs. DERACE MARKETING STRATEGY DeRace team is into real horsing experience : forming partnerships with jockey clubs, hippodromes and associations. They have already onboarded two and are actively working on onboarding more.DeRace is also but securing partnerships with existing and upcoming NFT marketplaces such as Mintable.In negotiation with a few experienced PR and marketing agencies, who will handle advertising, social content creation & community management.Will introduce affiliate programs and reward systems.The team forms a partnership with streamers (mostly twitch).DeRace have a dedicated allocation pool of $500k for KOLs from private round and they are currently carefully screening and selecting them. WHAT MAKES DERACE UNIQUE? DeRace is a combination of 3 booming multi-billion-dollar markets: Gaming and horse racing all together valued at more than $700 billion. The digitalization of the billion-dollar horse racing market is practically non-existent and it's full of corruption, fraud and lacks transparency. DeRace brings the latest technologies to the market, such as blockchain and NFT's and offers decentralized solutions to ensure transparency.The gaming industry lacks ownership and uniqueness, and all assets in a video game can be used only in-game. In DeRace, all game assets are NFTs and can be used, or sold outside the game.Betting industry profits from player losses, rather than creating a sustainable and healthy environment. Online betting games also have dull and predictable gameplay while lacking in safety, and privacy. DeRace is focused on growing and earning with the player base, introduces GA and RNG technology, brings exciting gameplay, and ensures safety and privacy by utilising the blockchain. There is also a huge unfulfilled demand for games with betting features; DeRace combines video gaming and betting, focusing on both markets equally and simultaneously. DERACE PRODUCT ROADMAP We are aiming to introduce our game-changing platform by the end of this year and fully arm it with all the exciting features next year.  DERACE REVENUE STREAMS Unlike many NFT and even crypto projects, DeRace is being built to start generating revenue from the get-go. The revenue models are as diverse as they are sustainable. These include NFT asset drops, Horse breeding fees, Hippodrome sales, NFT Horse drops, and the main projected revenue stream of 5% fees collected from Hippodromes profits. DERACE PRODUCT DIVE DeRace is a platform that simulates real-life horse racing and gives players the ultimate horse racing experience. It contains not only the race itself but also other parts of the industry: Horse owners can own, breed, and trade horses as well as compete in races.Hippodromes host races, compete against each other, and attract participants and bettors.The bettors place bets on preferred horses. NFT horses Like real-life racehorses, DeRace NFT horses have different traits that define their rarity, performance, cool-down time, and ultimately, value. NFT horse is a valuable asset that allows you to participate in races and earn payouts.  DeRace NFT horses perform differently on various racetracks: some horses are faster on dirt, some on turf and some on synthetic surfaces.  Performance also depends on racetrack length: some horses are excellent in short distances while some are outstanding in long ones.  Players have to race your NFT horse in different hippodromes to find out what type of races your horse prefers.  Horse breeding In DeRace two NFT horses create a third NFT horse. The player can select male and female horses and add Love Potion NFT to initiate the breeding potion. The horse of the next generation is crested. (For example Gen 0 NFT horses generate Gen 1 offspring). Both NFT horse tokens are sent to GA (Genetic Algorithm) via Ethereum smart contract. GA generates a third NFT horse combining genes from parent horses, with +- 5% deviation (RNG factor is applied).  Rent-a-horse Horse renting system that allows players to rent their NFT horse for breeding and racing and earn rewards.  NFT Horse races Up to 12 horses participate in each race. Every horse participates in the race for a set fee. The winner of the race collects a % of the participants’ fees and also any other additional prizes, which are then automatically transferred to the winner’s account.  Race entry mechanics All planned races will be displayed on the upcoming races board. Players can access the board and filter the races by date, entrance criteria, entry fee, player quantity, hosting hippodrome, and winning pool, to select the most suitable ones to join.  NFT Hippodromes All horse races take place in hippodromes. Hippodromes in the DeRace metaverse are community owned. The hippodrome owner determines both participation fees and other criteria before each race.  As in the real world, the hippodromes in the DeRace metaverse vary in track length and surface. Some racetracks are shorter, and some — longer distance. The tracks in the hippodromes also have different surfaces: it varies among dirt, turf or synthetic.  Performance boosting assets Performance boosting asset NFT can be purchased and be used to increase the performance of the racing horse as well as be given out as prizes to the winners. Tournaments  Once in a while, special tournaments are hosted in the dedicated hippodromes offering exclusive prizes. By participating in these racing events players will be able to acquire amazing prizes from sponsors like DeRace, Binance and many others and prove themselves as the ultimate DeRace metaverse champion. TECHNOLOGIES USED BY DERACE Genetic Algorithm GA (genetic algorithm) is similar to how biological genetics work in reality, where genes — your DNA — store information about the rest of your body. For example eye, skin and hair color, hair structure, body type, and height. In a GA, numbers represent various characteristics. NFT + Polygon Smart Contract Combining NFT with Polygon smart contract allows breeding horses (in a GA, it is called a crossover). It creates another unique token out of the other two, keeping some of the information (features) previous tokens had written in the smart contract. RNG Algorithm The DeRace Controlled RNG algorithm is used for breeding and racing: In horse breeding, GA generates the third NFT horse combining genes from parent horses, with +- 5% deviation (RNG factor is applied). That means that even if both parents had the property of speed 20 - their child's speed can be in norms from 19 to 21.In racing, the RNG algorithm will choose a winner out of all participating horses of the race. Horses with higher speed have a higher chance of winning. But since it's an RNG-based game even the slowest horse has a small chance to win. For Racing and breeding RNG ""Provable"" - blockchain-based RNG will be used. In-game NFT marketplace On in-game NFT marketplace where NFT horses and other NFT assets can be traded among players.  Player Earnings One of the priorities in DeRace's operation is to enable players to diversify their income sources by easily and instantly earning DeRace coins in different ways. Players can earn DERC in the following activities: BreedingTrading NFT horsesParticipating in racesHosting races in hippodromesSelling analysis and predictionsReferral programsReward programsBug reporting  DERACE TOKEN ECONOMY $DERC DeRace's native coin (DERC) is an ERC20 based cryptographic token that complies with the Ethereum system and can be traded on the Ethereum blockchain. DeRace platform economy will run exclusively on DeRace Coin. $DERC is also briget to BSC and MATIC. $DERC is listed on Crypto.com, Gate.io, PancakeSwap, UniSwap, Quickswap DERC Utility The first and foremost function of $DERC is to fuel the whole platform. Even though DeRace crowdfunding activities allow transactions in both $DERC and other traditional means of payment, $DERC will ultimately serve as the base currency for transactions within the DeRace universe. All activities on the platform, including races, breeding, renting, winnings, and asset trades are executed exclusively in $DERC. Also, all player earnings are paid out only in $DERC. This guarantees constant token volume and circulating supply. DeRace Referral and Reward Systems use exclusively $DERC. Wallet users, influencers, social media accounts, blogs, or news outlets will all receive their referral rewards in $DERC. Token holder benefits $DERC holders take part in the decision-making governance process with regards to the development of the DeRace platform. Token holders also get premium early access to the platform, exclusive access to the NFT drops at a special price, and will be the first ones invited to try new features.

VENT FINANCE PRODUCT ROADMAP VENT FINANCE REVENUE STREAMS  HOW DOES VENT FINANCE WORK?  Launchpad - VENT is making the user journey as simple and enjoyable as possible by improving every factor involved, such as design, customer support, wallet and API integrations, mobile app, platform level KYC, etc. It's all in the details. The team's laser focus on product and high quality design brings much needed attention to what they believe is a crucial part of the equation to increase user adoption in DeFi and open investment opportunities to everyone.DEX - The next logical step after the launch is a DEX, where project owners can lock the liquidity and community members will be one click away from trading the tokens they just acquired or switching their funds to participate in the next IDO.Marketplace - Project owners need trustworthy partners to help build and market their products . Finding such partners and providers can be challenging, as there are a lot of new players in the space without a proven track record. Service providers are not inclined to trust unknown projects and often demand upfront payments. Projects don't want to pay upfront fees, as they don't have a guarantee about the quality of the service. VentCommerce will remove this cumbersome and trustless process and erase any doubts from these engagements by utilising the power of smart contracts and on-chain reputation to simplify these relationships. In this way, VENT will enable projects to find the partners they need in a secure environment protected from potential scams. TECHNOLOGIES USED BY VENT FINANCE VentUp Launchpad - is powered by ETH based $VENT token, that will be wrapped to use on other chains. Once you hold $VENT you are eligible to stake and earn points that will be used to participate in future launches.

Opulous brings Decentralized Finance to the music industry, providing a launchpad for the first music copyright-backed NFTs as well as DeFi loans that will change how artists access the funding they need. The platform comprises three main functions: NFT LaunchpadNFT ExchangeDeFi Loans Opulous Music NFTs are a new form of Non-Fungible Token, offering buyers a share of a song's future royalty earnings and exclusive rewards in exchange for social media support. Opulous peer-to-peer DeFi loans cut out traditional banks, middle-men and major labels, allowing artists to access up-front cash based on the predictable royalties they generate over 12 months. OPULOUS GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY Composition Phase The Opulous platform will launch a number of exclusive NFT sales with major artists, before opening the NFT Launchpad to all artists worldwide. Production Phase During the production phase they will implement the royalty payments and rewards to NFT holders and they will also complete the development of the DeFi loan component and NFT Exchange. Resonance Phase In this last phase, Opulous will be introduced to thousands more artists and potential users worldwide via the vast network of partners and influencers. Opulous will also educate potential users on the platform's USPs, benefits and the processes necessary to engage with Opulous, while continuing to make the platform as accessible as possible for musicians, investors and all new users globally. OPULOUS PRODUCT VIABILITY Opulous is a music industry first, with no direct competitors and only a small number of other projects occupying the same space. Unlike most other blockchain projects, Opulous is based on real-world music assets with stable and predictable value. The $OPUL token can be used to receive special discounts across the platform and token holders will also get exclusive access to major NFT drops. Opulous founder Lee Parsons is also the CEO of global music distribution platform Ditto Music. This partnership will introduce the platform to over 500k musicians worldwide from launch.  OPULOUS PRODUCT ROADMAP  OPULOUS REVENUE STREAMS  OPULOUS PRODUCT DIVE NFT Launchpad Opulous is the first platform to launch music copyright-backed NFTs. Unlike other NFTs, Opulous tokens offer buyers a share in the music's future royalty earnings alongside exclusive rewards and fan experiences. These groundbreaking NFTs will generate monthly royalty revenue and increase in value as an artist's career progresses. Fans and investors will not only receive royalty payments, but also be able to unlock other exclusive rewards, such as backstage passes, gig tickets and merchandise, simply by sharing the music on social media. NFT owners can also track and withdraw their earnings directly from their Opulous account. Plus they'll be tradable on the upcoming Opulous NFT Exchange. NFT Exchange The Opulous NFT Exchange creates a new sharing economy based on music, where anyone can buy and trade music copyright-backed NFTs to earn a share of the royalties generated. For example, a music fan could find an underrated song they know is going to become more popular over time. They can buy it as an Opulous NFT, support an upcoming artist right from the start of their career and earn ever-increasing rewards as the track becomes more valuable while gaining popularity. DeFi Loans Opulous introduces low-risk DeFi loans backed by real-world music assets and future royalties. Despite earning a stable royalty income, too many artists are turned away by traditional banks or forced into unfair deals with major labels. With Opulous, musicians can fund new projects with DeFi loans up to the value of the royalties they generate over 12 months. On the other side, investors can stake their crypto assets on the platform to generate high returns. Unlike most DeFi platforms, Opulous loans are always backed by predictable music assets vetted by the expert team, which greatly reduces risk on investment. TECHNOLOGIES USED AND CREATED BY OPULOUS Ethereum Blockchain (NFTs) Phase one of the Opulous NFT Launchpad is being built on Ethereum. Ethereum is currently the most established blockchain for NFTs and has the most liquidity and accessibility. Algorand Blockchain (DeFi) Opulous's DeFi component is being built on the Algorand blockchain. Algorand is built around its permissionless Pure Proof-of-Stake protocol and is renowned for its security, efficiency and scalability. NFTs Opulous music NFTs involve the sale of embedded, fractionalised rights to royalties from music copyright assets, through the associated meta-data of that music copyright. Opulous will receive, collect and pay royalty revenues from music platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to holders of each NFT sold on the platform. Smart Contracts Opulous Smart Contracts will facilitate the agreements and split payments of royalty share earnings and rewards from any music associated with a specific NFT. Decentralized Exchange Opulous is building it's own Decentralized NFT Exchange, where users can freely buy, sell and trade music NFTs. The NFT Exchange will offer users the opportunity to buy music NFTs early in an artist's career, hold them as they gain popularity and increase in value - and then sell or trade them later for a higher price. OPULOUS TOKEN ECONOMY All transactions with the platform will use the native $OPUL token, which can be purchased using ETH, stablecoins and FIAT currencies. 	5465	0.0010978956999085087	0.0	0.0009149130832570906

Welcome to Cross-Chain Risk Parity Smart Farming 2.0 Formation Fi revolutionizes portfolio construction by introducing a risk-adjusted portfolio of decentralized open financial crypto assets in the form of algorithmically rebasing indexes, with a high degree of composability, across the major blockchain networks using the basic principles of the Risk Parity movement. The systematic architecture constructs a risk-adjusted portfolio that optimizes the return-to-risk ratio for each unit of risk, ultimately delivering a superior return over time. Through prioritizing secular diversification, the risk parity rebalancing mechanism sorts ""smart-asset allocation"" by pairing counter-trend, cross-chain assets within their four classes of index coins to reduce the overall risk at a fundamental level. Formation Fi rethinks how Formation interacts with risks in DeFi and uses its data-driven insights to algorithmically construct a portfolio that will outperform through all environmental changes over time. FORMATION FI MARKETING STRATEGY Summer of 2020 started the mass adoption of Defi. The Formation Fi team calls it Defi Summer 1.0. Summer of 2021 will start the mass recognition of Smart Yield Farming 2.0. The Formation Fi team calls it Defi Summer 2.0, and it intends to unveil the Defi Summer 2.0, with its unique partnership program described below. Step One: Create and expand the Form Gang through influencers and cross-chain partnerships (aka. Defi Legends). The Formation Fi Ecosystem includes more than 150 top ecosystem partners as an integral part of the Form Gang whose mission is to advocate Smart Yield Farming 2.0 as the next logical evolutionary step of yield farming in the age of the multi-chain Web3 ecosystem.To gain rapid adoption for the Form token, every month after the official public listing, Formation Fi will initiate the double-reward special staking pool program with a progressively increasing reward ratio with the most trusted partners, they call the Defi Legends, such as Polygon (ERC) and Refinable (BSC) who can bring their community members to the Formation Fi ecosystem.Starting with Polygon, Formation will introduce risk-free, double-reward AMM staking pools available only to the native token holders of the Defi Legends. For a limited time, for example, Polygon's Matic holders will have a single-sided exposure to a Matic-only pool, which will then be connected to a Matic:Form paired pool created by Formation Fi in the backend. This simpler staking mechanic will allow the Matic holders to farm a double-reward in Form tokens without the hassle of manually creating an LP token themselves.Each of the hand-crafted pools will be designed to usher the communities of their Legend Partners into the Formation FI ecosystem. Each pool will limit the size of the cap and reward ratio to make sure that the demand stays strong and constant throughout the program. Each limited special pool will be heavily promoted by their Defi Legend Partners across all their user-base in all major channels. To access such pools, each user will be required to own a certain number of partners' native assets.Within the month immediately following the public offering, as illustrated below, Formation Fi will increase the reward ratio with a new Defi Legend in the pipeline and the corresponding announcement will be made at the end of each month. Community anticipation for the program will be high. For example, more than 70,000 Matic holders have already applied for the program at the time of this publication.  Formation currently has several partners committed to joining the Defi Legend Program. Step Two: Launch Raging Bull Alpha Index. The first product, Raging Bull Alpha Index, will be released on the back of Form Gang (described above). Raging Bull Alpha Index will include Defi's most high-growth assets with liquidity mining characteristics and yield farming strategies across ERC, BSC and HECO while hiding all the complexities in a single asset exposure (index) like user experience. With one click onboarding process, it will make defi as easy as clicking a button.Raging Bull Alpha through high APY across-chain index strategy will be capped to $250M TVL. It will be with anti-dump protection by introducing price point incentives for back orders.  Step Three: Launch Infinity Alpha Dark Pools for SHO. Formation Fi will introduce the Infinity Alpha Dark Pools to the strong holders of Form only. As the Form Gang grows in size and stickiness, select form token holders will have the exclusive access to their dark pools consisting of highly curated staking pools for exclusive deals.By lack of approachability and exclusivity, they expect high interest from the Form Gang. It will include exclusive yield farming products for a limited time, fueled only by a small number of projects backed by the industry top heavyweights in Defi who are a part of Formation Founders Club.  Step Four: Launch Web 3 Formational Beta, Fixed Income Gamma, and Risk Parity progressively. This phase marks the ever expanding community growth by introducing a full suite of indexes designed by the Formation FI ecosystem. Each index category will be unveiled on a quarterly release schedule.At this stage, the Formation FI ecosystem should have no less than 100,000 monthly active users. WHAT MAKES FORMATION FI UNIQUE? The product viability can be summed up in two phrases: a) Radical Simplification and b) Risk Management through Diversification and Indexing. As of yet, there is no such product or service available in Defi. Formation Fi's risk parity will be radically simple to use. Defi, as one of the most prominent applications of Blockchain, is not practical to use for most investors. It's because Defi user experience is riddled with ever evolving protocols, lack of easy-to-navigate and unified user interface and lack of security. Today's Defi is for those few who understand the technical jargon and the in's and out's of the complex web of applications. Some of us commonly call them Degens (i.e. degenerates), because they are short-term focused, unashamedly shilling pump-and-dump schemers. In short, they are speculators. The current Defi money legos essentially have no interoperable, easy-to-use interface for risk-averse and more discerning investors (as opposed to speculators). There is no bridge between the regular finance world and the Defi community and it's very difficult for regular investors to add liquidity to Defi protocols.Formation Fi stands for risk-adjusted investment through diversification. It uses risk calibration to determine balanced allocations across various components of an investment portfolio. Risk parity was pioneered by some of the largest hedge funds in the world, and has been used to manage and grow portfolios worth hundreds of billions of dollars with great success. To translate a risk parity approach to crypto and DeFi, Formation Fi's algorithm determines what factors underpin this strategy and whether and how they can be replicated in an algorithmic and decentralized fashion.   FORMATION FI PRODUCT ROADMAP  HOW DOES FORMATION FI WORK?  FORMATION FI REVENUE STREAMS All revenues will be generated from the fees collected when index tokens are minted and withdrawn:  WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY FORMATION FI Formation Fi will be converting R statistical optimization software into Solidity so that correlation matrix across all assets across multiple chains can be constructed on-chain. This is the first time ever attempted in Defi. FORMATION FI TOKEN ECONOMY Form token is the governance token that entitles the holder on-going profit sharing and access to special investment opportunities on the platform. All income generated by the protocol will either be distributed to $FORM holders on a pro rata basis or burned according to the following plan: $FORM holders will receive 50% of the fee collected by the protocolThe operational treasury will also receive 50% for the core development team on a pari passu basis until the total USD value of the operational treasury reaches a daily maximum of $1M.Once the daily maximum has been reached, any further fees will be burned as a deflationary measure (only fees allocated to operational treasury are burned, fees continue to be paid to $FORM holders). This and other parameters could be subject to change as the result of a governance vote, beginning 12 months after IDO.

Gamestarters is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform that helps indie game developers to fundraise by pre-selling unique in-game assets in the form of NFTs. Additionally, Gamestarter provides a marketplace to trade digital assets from successfully launched games. Gamestarter's platform economy will run on GAME Coin ('GAME'), which will power all transactions on the platform as well as referral bonuses and reward programs. Gamestarter will: Provide developers with advantageous funding opportunities. Developers will be able to fundraise while retaining full equity and IP.Introduce new revenue streams for gamers and developers alike.Establish a Rich Token-Based Economy. Powering referral bonuses, digital goods, reward programs, and more.Provide effective marketing tools by giving developers access and exposure to the StartNFT community. GAMESTARTER MARKETING STRATEGY Gamestarters has a dedicated allocation of $500,000 to KOLs, which were carefully selected to help with the marketing and community development.It is negotiating with a few prominent marketing agencies, who will handle PR, advertising & community management.They will form partnerships with other NFT-based projects and indie game development studios.They will introduce affiliate programs and reward systems. WHAT MAKES GAMESTARTER UNIQUE? Because of the relative novelty of the NFT technology, and the innovative approach of blending the concept of pre-selling NFTs to crowdfund indie games, currently there are no direct competitors for StartNFT. However there is a clear demand for both: new video games and NFTs. Indie games raise hundreds of millions from gamers across the world on major crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and from equity crowdfunding. Both funding routes have certain drawbacks.  Tokenized funding does not work for everyone Despite the growing popularity of blockchain-based games, most games cannot run token sales as they do not want to implement a utility token in their game. Because utility tokens cannot be securities, if a token commits to offering what equity crowdfunding offers, ownership in a startup, then the token sale is illegal. This forces tokens to act solely on a utility basis, and that means they need to fit into some digital economy. The necessity for tokens to only be valuable within a digital economy is a hyper limitation as then only blockchain-enabled products are reasonable fits.  However, all games can have playable items that can be converted to NFTs. NFTs in the gaming ecosystem Games are probably the only sustainable implementation of NFTs: Game items are massive economies.Game items are often non-fungible digital items with a utility: skins for showing off or celebrating, weapons for combat, resources for creation, unique trading cards etc.Game items are heavily adopted among the global game economy; a $160 billion business that grows by 10% or more every year.Game items are a form of investment. They are an entire asset class that is far bigger than all current NFT marketplaces put together.Game items have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and often goes up in value as the game gains traction. Why Gamestarter is the new standard of game crowdfunding Gamestarter is the first platform to combine traditional crowdfunding opportunities with the benefits of tokenized funding. Game developers issue digital in-game assets as NFTs. They can be purchased as investment assets or simply as playables by gamers on the Gamestarter marketplace. Unlike using tokenized funding, game developers do not have to issue utility tokens. And unlike traditional crowdfunding, gamers do not need to participate in illiquid and high-risk crowdfunding. While millions of gamers around the world are funding games by buying playable assets, the system is risky and illiquid. Gamestarter does not only tap into the huge game crowdfunding market but considerably grows the participation of gamers in crowdfunding by making the market hyper liquid, less risky and more accessible. GAMESTARTER PRODUCT ROADMAP  GAMESTARTER REVENUE STREAMS  HOW DOES GAMESTARTER WORK? Crowdfunding platform Gamestarter is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform that helps indie game developers to fundraise by pre-selling unique in-game assets in the form of NFTs. Only meticulously screened and expert-rated projects will be listed on StartNFT ensuring the highest possible future asset value. Similar to Kickstarter's proven business model, funding on Start NFT is all-or-nothing. No one will be charged for a pledge towards a project unless it reaches its funding goal. NFT marketplace Gamestarter provides a marketplace to trade digital assets from successfully launched games. Giving the NFTs owners as much agency as possible and the ability to sell and realize real-world value from their holdings is essential for the NFT ecosystem to thrive. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY GAMESTARTER? Gamestarter - is powered by ETH based GAME Coin token. Once you get GAME Coin you are eligible to purchase any NFT assets or product on the Gamestarter network. To maximize security they use proven and audited technology. The basic infrastructure on Gamestarter is built by integrating already existing solutions and practices that have been proven over time. The encrypted seed phrase, along with other sensitive data like addresses, keys, and account data, is securely saved in the browser's local storage. No online app, website, or provider can access any of that secured data - the user remains with total control over their wallet. To store and manage accounts, MetaMask's Eth-Keyring library used. They leverage audited and proven open source solutions to minimize the possibility of error. GAMESTARTER TOKEN ECONOMY All funding and asset trading activity on the marketplace will be powered by Gamestarter's coin ""GAME"". GAME token holders will benefit from: - Trading fee discounts on the NFT marketplace if the native token is used for fees. - VIP access to the hottest in-game NFT assets. The best (oversubscribed) game items will be issued via allocation lotteries to GAME holders. GAME tokens will also be used as an engagement incentive to the community.

Pera Finance is a trading & yield farming protocol based on decentralized trading competitions. PERA token will be the proof of concept of the general trading protocol by which its underlying technology will be integrated for the other projects with their own trading competition for their tokens. Pera Finance brings a new type of trader-oriented yield farming protocol via decentralized trading competitions - a first-ever in DeFi. its modular and scalable smart contract solutions open a new era to build more robust financial ecosystems around customizable trading competitions. Pera Finance rewards its users according to their contribution to the ecosystem by using different yield strategies including PERA and other partner projects' tokens. PERA FINANCE MARKETING STRATEGY Pera has partnered with two marketing agencies; GuerillaBuzz and Grey Turkey. Guerilla Buzz leads the viral marketing part where Grey Turkey handles the social m'edia aspect. Grey Turkey is also building the brand strategy and it's at the final stage. Pera is working with multiple KOLs from different regions and also in talks with potential ecosystem partners to get in touch with their user base and networks. Pera Finance aims to further expand the trading competition across the BSC network by completing pre-launch partnership agreements and launching PERA Tokens on multiple AMM-type exchanges. The pools where PERA Token will be launched will offer PERA Token users additional revenue models where PERA liquidity farmers can earn tokens of partner projects. Also, this is going to be the first DeFi project out of Turkey and they have strong local connections to attract local investors. WHAT MAKES PERA FINANCE UNIQUE? PERA is the world's first DeFi platform to offer an on-chain daily trading competition. So there is not a direct competitor for the market they are aiming for. Pera trading solutions will be applicable to many other projects as well. As a general competition, Pera Finance aims to attract all the users from other yield farming protocols that subsidize their liquidity with emissions or non incentivized transaction fees (deflationary yield farming projects in general just as Safemoon). How are they better & The Potential Demand In the DeFi space, yield farming rewards are usually created to boost supply-side liquidity via unsustainable inflationary or deflationary mechanisms. However, none of the existing DeFi protocols have a hybrid farming mechanism that also rewards the creation of demand-side liquidity and rewards their traders for the sake of trading. PERA is rewarding the volume creation of its users in order to benefit both liquidity providers that need active traders to utilize their liquidity and the traders who haven't been rewarded for their trading efforts so far.  PERA token is the proof of concept of Pera Finance's Trading Protocol which will extend the unique approach and services to the whole DeFi space. PERA's modular and scalable sorting solution opens a new era for the existing or new DeFi projects and DEXes for a more sustainable and robust ecosystem. The trading protocol will be integrated into the projects that have a long-term trading volume for their tokens and sustain their user base.  PERA FINANCE PRODUCT ROADMAP  PERA FINANCE REVENUE STREAMS   HOW DOES PERA FINANCE WORK? PERA Trading & Yield Farming Protocol (For the PERA tokens) The Yield Farming protocol has emission (inflationary) and transaction fee (deflationary) based farming rewards for the PERA holders, PERA liquidity providers of the Pancakeswap pool and Top-10 PERA traders (volume creators of any kind). Daily and decentralized trading competition is the main attraction point and trigger of the yield farming protocol. It restarts on a 24-hour interval. So, there's a decentralized trading competition with the PERA tokens that kickstarts the yield farming protocol that collects the transaction fees in addition to the daily emission rewards.  Emission rewards are used to attract the traders and liquidity providers, when they use the tokens Pera applies transaction fees to add them up to the emission rewards. So, the more transactions there are, the more farming rewards for the traders and the liquidity providers they provide.  Deflationary Rewards Every on-chain PERA transaction (transfer, trade, or liquidity addition/ removal) generates a 2 % transaction fee. All transaction fees are distributed to PERA Holders, Traders, and Liquidity Providers as deflationary rewards. Inflationary Rewards Daily emission is 70.000 PERA. All emission rewards are distributed to PERA Traders and Liquidity Providers as inflationary rewards.  Pera Trading Protocol (For the Other Projects) Pera will extend and customize the trading competition feature to the other projects to have their own trading competitions in their terms. The mechanism described above has been designed for the PERA token. The general trading protocol will allow other projects to decide on their competition interval, number of traders to be rewarded, amount of the competition rewards etc with their own terms. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY PERA FINANCE? The smart contract is customly designed and has an unique functionality described as the ""Decentralized Trading Competition"". Everyday, Top 10 traders with the highest volume are sorted out of a list of all traders with the unique sorting algorithm. It's a well known fact that using sorting algorithms in Solidity is hard due to intensive gas usage. Pera has developed a new sorting algorithm using a unique ""filter-and-sort"" approach.  This underlying solution and the internal volume oracle the contract has (the smart contract can track every single PERA tx and store the corresponding volume to feed the sorting algorithm for the trading competition) are their own creations and will also be the base of the general trading protocol that Pera will implement to the other projects for their own decentralized trading competitions.

Looking to the future, OpenOcean will further aggregate derivatives, yield-generation, lending, insurance products as well on both DeFi and CeFi and launch our own combined margin products and intelligent wealth management products. OPENOCEAN MARKETING STRATEGY Being the leading aggregator on Binance Smart Chain, they encourage users to take OpenOcean as an entrance to BSC by educating users on how to maximize their profits through trading on OpenOcean at the best price and then participate in other DeFi projects. OpenOcean also provides tools for users to compare the price between CEXes and DEXes, and support users to make their choice. Currently, they have campaigns together with swaps, wallets and other projects for promotions in both communities. For example, it teamed up with Pancake and safepal wallet on BSC for campaigns by trading on OpenOcean. They also teamed up with ad hoc projects such as Reef and Seascape when they list their tokens and encourage users to trade their tokens on OpenOcean with the best price. OpenOcen also has campaigns with TrustWallet after the implementation of the mobile version. They also attract users by 0 fee and slippage subsidy and educate wallet users to take OpenOcean as an entrance to BSC and Defi trading. OpenOcean continuously aggregates DEXes on existing public chains such as BSC, Ethereum, Ontology, and TRON that can be beneficial to users by offering better prices and more liquidity. They are also working on the aggregation of DEX ecosystems on Solana and others to offer more liquidity and assets for users. In Q2 2021, it will list OOE token and do token airdrops. 2% of OOE token will be sent to eligible addresses to incetive users that traded on OpenOcean before token issuance. They will also start liquidity mining on aggregated DEXes and CEXes as well as on OpenOcean to boost its user numbers and trading volume. In Q2 2021, OpenOcean will start to aggregate derivative products. They will further aggregate yield products, lending and insurance products. Then it will launch combined margin products and intelligent wealth management after all the infrastructures are done. By offering users with the most well-rounded product portfolio in the crypto world, the users take OpenOcean as their entrance for trading. One more important thing is that they offer institutional investors with tailor-making user interface service to help facilitate their investment strategies on the aggregated CEXes and DEXes.

Currently, the solution is implemented on Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum. Delta Theta provides a logical structure that includes four types of contracts: - Buying an opportunity to buy (Buy CALL option) - Buying an opportunity to sell (Buy PUT option) - Selling of obligation to buy upon request for execution (Sell CALL option) - Selling of opportunity to sell on-demand (Sell PUT option) The Delta Theta platform itself is not a party to the transaction, but only provides a set of comprehensive software solutions for organizing trades and obtaining equilibrium reference asset values. DELTA.THETA MARKETING STRATEGY Choosing among a variety of possible areas of profit at the moment of entering the market, Delta Theta is primarily focused on the segment of ""farmers"" on Binance Smart Chain (hereinafter BSC) and then on traders. BSC was chosen because it is the most popular blockchain for cryptocurrency trading and getting profit from alternative ways of capital management, typical only for the crypto market. Existing competitive solutions on the market either do not use this blockchain or are centralized. Delta Theta has developed a simple, clear and functional product for ""farmers"". By using Delta Theta LITE, any farmer can qualitatively increase his APY in 3 clicks by choosing a simple ready-made risk management scheme. Delta Theta product addresses two major pain points of ""farmers"": 1. First, through Delta Theta, farmers buy protection during the farming period. The farmer invests in stablecoins and ""strong"" coins (ETH), and the output is a coin that is subject to a significant drop. Thus, the farmer needs to get protection from the dump of the token that is being farmed. 2. Efficient capital management. Today's farmers in search of APY growth use quite a wide range of products, from simple farming to flash-loans solutions. Options allow them to participate with less capital leverage. They started out with a simple one - by allowing farmers to sell options. You sell an option - and you make money. They give the farmer an opportunity to make money on his desire to use his own capital more efficiently. Example: Let's say, a farmer wants to sell a coin at a higher price and comes to delta.theta. He can use the Sell High option and place a limit order through delta.theta LITE app. And that's where the magic begins: a. First, his order can go into LIP (disabling feature) - this means that his order is deposited on the Venus protocol and the farmer is paid the appropriate APY b. Secondly, if the buyer bought the farmer's option, he paid him a premium. But the option may not be executed. So, the farmer has already earned in 2 places just on his desire to be efficient. An additional target audience is active traders who need the following unique functionality: 1. Tools - the platform provides a flexible response to demand. Adding a new fully tradable asset will take less than a few hours. 2. Liquidity - They have a commission system, oriented on the liquidity provider in the order book, the incentive system for liquidity delivery through Liquidity Incentivize Programme, as well as our own pool of market makers. 3. Analytics - They do analytics, where they express our personal opinion. Of course, it is not a recommendation to buy or sell of this or that asset, but they are sure that it can be very useful for traders. To address the specific needs of traders, we have a PRO version of our delta.theta terminal. WHAT MAKES DELTA.THETA UNIQUE? Today, the cryptocurrency market exceeds $2 trillion in capitalization. The market is well developed in terms of spot trading and margin services and centralized trading. It is characterized by high volatility and competition in the provision of classic, basic exchange services. At the same time, it is also worth noting that the process of new product introduction in the crypto-financial market is much faster than in traditional markets. Due to this speed, in a few years, the cryptocurrency market has passed the way that the classic market passed in centuries. However, the cryptocurrency market lacks a large-scale and professional implementation of such a tool as an option. In traditional finance, options serve as a reference tool for calculating the profitability of an investment strategy and are often used as a market version of risk protection. Nowadays, options are already badly needed by ""farmers"" - users of a new specific sphere of capital turnover, in which participants place their assets in an independent ""smart"" contract within the framework of trust and security in a liquidity fund. delta.theta is just such a platform, which provides an advanced infrastructure and ready-made solutions to control and minimize risks for any participants of the crypto market. Moreover, with the help of delta.theta products and tools, it will be possible to not only use options for classic purposes, but also innovative tools to extend and maximize the toolkit of making profit from capital management.  DELTA.THETA PRODUCT ROADMAP  HOW DOES DELTA.THETA WORK? Delta.theta isn't a beneficiary of the executed platform transactions, but only provides a set of comprehensive software solutions to organize trading and obtain equilibrium reference asset values. The platform architecture, as part of the implementation on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain and Ethereum, supports the following functionality: Unlimited expirationsThe pairing of any coins for the corresponding blockchainAmerican-style options (execute at any time prior to the expiration date)Limit and market orders. Limit order - user chooses the parameters (price, term). Market order - the user buys/sells what is available in the trading terminal.2-level system of commissions. Maker fee - if the user adds liquidity to the order book (puts an order not at the current market), a reduced commission is applied to it. Taker fee - if the user removes liquidity from the order book (takes out the current orders), the standard commission is applied to him.Sellers of options pledge 100% of the collateral, thus the failure of the contract is not possible.Option sellers can participate in the Liquidity Incentivize Program. Their placed orders can be forwarded to protocols like Venus, where option sellers can earn extra money. DELTA.THETA REVENUE STREAMS Delta Theta has two main revenue streams: DEX fees (Maker/Taker fees).Revenue from token usage. Delta.theta token can be used to pay for analytical services of delta.theta. The company publishes the following materials on a weekly basis:weekly reviewMarket ideasToken overviews Delta.Theta estimated revenue plan.  WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY DELTA.THETA?  DELTA.THETA TOKEN ECONOMY The delta.theta token has a utility function. First of all, any platform user with a token receives a discount based on the volume of tokens available (discounts are applied to the appropriate order type): 5 000 tokens 10%25 000 tokens 20%100 000 tokens 50% Secondly, delta.theta token can be used to pay for analytical services of delta.theta. The company publishes the following materials on a weekly basis: weekly reviewmarket ideasToken overviews Market ideas and token overviews will be available only for users utilizing delta.theta tokens from July 15, 2021.

Lossless brings a trusted and safe DeFi ecosystem with minimal to no losses from hacks, exploits, or social engineering. As a team of experienced engineers, finance professionals, as well as DeFi experts and white hat hackers, Lossless team is dedicated to making crypto investing accessible and safe. Together they are building a new protocol for reliable DeFi investment and development to support blockchain technologies' growth. Lossless, aims to create a place where everyone could employ their money quickly with minimum risk. With a safer environment for everyone and increasing the adoption of DeFi markets. Lossless protocol - at its core, a piece of code that token creators insert into their tokens - this code empowers Lossless to freeze any fraudulent transaction based on a set of fraud identification parameters. There two-step process for recovering stolen funds: Urgent/instant freezing after a hack - this step is community and technology-based, rewarding the one who identifies the hack and freezes the transaction.Longer/permanent freezing occurs after a hack was verified by the Lossless committee, company, and token creator, which takes steps to reverse the fraudulent transaction. LOSSLESS MARKETING STRATEGY Lossless primary focus areas will be: Business DevelopmentEarly Adoption IncentivesInfluencer marketingAffiliate and referrals Product/Token Highly correlated tokenomics - product success, with its ability to freeze hacks, is designed to impact and create interest for LSS token. Business Development Partnerships and integrations with existing and upcoming tokens will be one of their protocol's driving forces. Lossless will be dedicating part of the team of sales and business development people to talk to as many existing and newly established token creators to integrate lossless protocol. Early Adoption Incentives Lossless will provide early adoption incentives, such as tokens for projects that join early. Influencer Marketing Influencers are the main access gate to a broader reach of the right audience in the crypto world, as trust is one of the industry's critical values. Lossless goal is to cooperate with influencers who have proved their integrity and understanding of the crypto world. Such personalities usually have an enormous following and can motivate many of their followers to use diverse products. Lossless will create long-lasting relations with all their customers, and they will work with a small number of influencers who will consequently become their brand's ambassadors. This is an effective way to gain more trust in the crypto world and boost its numbers. Affiliate And Referrals Lossless Affiliate and Referral Program will follow these steps: 1. They will talk to famous influencers and crypto bloggers who have an excellent reputation to spread the word about Lossless. 2. Anyone referring and successfully making token creators use Lossless code will receive a one-time incentive in the form of LSS tokens. WHAT MAKES LOSSLESS UNIQUE? Even though DeFi is proliferating, it is worth noticing that its technology, UX, accessibility, and security are still in early development stages. The constant hacking of core crypto platforms is hurting the crypto world. The latter is one of the core obstacles for a more comprehensive trust of the investor pool and adoption outside of the crypto world. According to the research done by Atlas VPN, there have been more than 122 major hacks, and a total of $3.8B has been stolen in 2020 alone. As cryptocurrencies become regulated, going from a niche investment to a mainstream asset held by millions of consumers, banks are expected to take the plunge into the digital asset space. With big banks joining in, hackers will become more incentivized to attack than ever before. Ethereum's smart contract Turing-completeness makes many DeFi projects prone to being exploited and hacked, resulting in investors' loss of funds. Although the space suffers an great problem there is almost an inexisting competition in the current DeFi cybersecurity market leaves room for rapid market share growth for Lossless. A 10% market share of $3.8B would imply the prevention of $380 million losses. And a 7% Lossless monetization fee would return $26.6 million in income for Lossless protocol. Keeping in mind that hacks and the hacked amounts increase, this brings a unique growth opportunity for the project.  LOSSLESS PRODUCT ROADMAP  LOSSLESS REVENUE STREAMS  HOW DOES LOSSLESS WORK? Lossless protocol is a piece of code that token creators insert into their tokens - this code empowers Lossless to freeze any fraudulent transaction based on a set of fraud identification parameters.

Two levels of loss mitigation A proof-of-stake hack finding platform An intuitive dashboard that allows manual overview and reporting for hack spottersBot friendly APIs for community-created hack-spotting botsA transparent reward system that guarantees high levels of participation and innovation Three Party Lossless Decision Making Structure This structure consists of three entities - Token Creator, Lossless Company, and Lossless Committee. The committee that overviews frozen transactions consists of investors with a significant share of LSS tokens and key public figures that provide trusted and unbiased decision-making, such as auditing firms. Lossless Protocol takes action immediately after a hack to mitigate its effects. Minutes after hack - anyone (finders) can freeze an address for 24-48 hours if they stake LSS tokensThe Lossless team reviews the frozen address to determine whether it's valid or notIf Yes - further steps are taken (see below); finders are rewarded a feeIf No - staked tokens of the finder are confiscated, the address is unfrozenHours after hack - Lossless company evaluates code, contacts contract owner If the hack is valid - the address is frozen for further 14 days, and a committee proposal is enacted for permanent transaction freezing and reversing the transaction.

Ternoa's main goal is to allow users to transmit digital memories/valuables to families, friends or others. These ""memories"" can include photos, videos, texts, wallet seeds, personal records and passwords wrapped as NFTS, or stored in their decentralized network only accessible by the NFT holder. These ""time-capsuled"" NFT items may represent digital assets, videos or pictures; personal belongings or human memories; confidential information that only the owner of the NFT will have access to - all pin-pointed to a specific time of creation within the time capsule. Ternoa brings together a team of Blockchain experts with complementary skills to offer a solution based on three pillars, which are key success factors: 1. A service accessible and adapted to the general public through decentralized apps, and a web version 2. An optimized Blockchain infrastructure to ensure security and long term data storage and transmission ; 3. A rational token and service model offering investors and future masternodes holders a clear and fair value creation trajectory To serve its Purpose Ternoa created a new special kind of NFT, the Secret NFT. This NFT is composed of two ""media"" one in lower quality, with a different image, or with a watermark, that can be viewed by the public, and one with the highest and full quality that can only be seen by the owner of the NFT. This opened up a lot of use cases in art, entertainment, legal tech, etc... TERNOA MARKETING STRATEGY A dedicated structure and subsidiary, CAPSULE CORP. LABS is carrying out the development of DAPPS. CAPSULE CORP. LABS benefits from equity investors resources to achieve this goal. Ternoa also relies on the advisor's influence and its investor's network. They handpicked the investors with the sole purpose to add value to the project To date, two dapps are being developed: Time Capsules - allowing users to send their personal data to close ones based on different protocols (check use cases below) → BtoC and BtoB use casesSecretNFT Marketplace - allowing users to purchase and create SecretNFTs with CAPS → BtoC and BtoB use casesA Software Development Kit (SDK) is made available to developers worldwide, to help create decentralized applications relying upon its blockchain. The infrastructure, protocols and Master Nodes network are made available to third party apps with long term storage and data transmission needs. The following leads are under commercial development with Tier 1 corporate entities: Luxury goods NFTs (contact established with a top tier French Couture brand)Medical records long term storage, and Dominique Pon, their advisor, intends to develop Ternoa in hospitals throughout France enabling patients to gather their last wills/wishes for their close ones.Music Industry - use of SecretNFTs for artist-fan relation Moreover, the seed round was only composed of non-crypto user's, but Ternoa's enthusiasts, professionals and individuals who candidly loved the use cases and wanted to use the Time Capsule Dapp. Ternoa launched an alpha version of this Dapp in November, and it was downloaded 10 000 times in 2 months. WHAT MAKES TERNOA UNIQUE? Ternoa reached 10K installations in a matter of 2 months with the alpha app last year, and the project is characterized by a very strong user's first community and investors. its Seed round was fully completed by non-crypto ""aficionados"" who are willing to hold tokens and use the Dapps Ternoa are developing. Most competitors are either long term storage off-chain solutions, or blockchains not built to handle long term data storage. The value proposition lies in the capacity to make it easy for everyone to use this network of decentralized storage blockchain, AND most of all to secure the transmission of the stored data attached to the NFT. The decentralized approach creates a strong differentiation against off-chain solutions. Moreover, its SecretNFT tackles the main problem of mainstream NFT where the media can be easily stolen and opens up new use cases for NFTs. The economic model designed to guarantee low and predictable gas cost across long periods allows us to differentiate from existing blockchains. The strong community built around use-cases developed, as well as mainstream influencers who got on board the project signals the GP's interest in their product. TERNOA PRODUCT ROADMAP  TERNOA REVENUE STREAMS The revenue Streams themselves can only come from the Dapps that will be developed on Ternoa's Blockchain: Time Capsule Dapp: Income from capsule sales in BtoCIncome from BtoB useBasic TimeCapsule NFT sales MarketPlace SecretNFT: Sales fees from the salesMarketing collaborations Other dapps in the process (see Use Cases) HOW DOES TERNOA WORK?  Time Capsules: They have different protocols of transmissions that can adapt to different use cases: Secret NFT Marketplace: Secret NFTs have use cases in:NFT Art industryInfluencers and KOL's industry by providing real unique private content to the fans and followersMusic industry for promotion purposesSpecial use cases with launchpadsand more... WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY TERNOA? Ternoa's chain is built atop Parity Substrate and they plan for it to be a parachain or para-thread on Polkadot. In order to protect the keys encrypting the data related to the Capsules (which are represented as NFTs) Ternoa is building an integration with Intel SGX Secure Enclaves technology.Every data is encrypted and segmented to be stored in its decentralized storage blockchain partners (SIA, StorJ, Aerwave expected for now)With Ternoa's Secret NFT feature the users can create NFTs that are linked to a set of encrypted data which only the owner of the NFT will be able to access. This is done in a totally decentralized and autonomous way without having to trust third parties. Similarly to the Capsules this builds atop Intel SGX and is generalizing this to all their usersA Software Development Kit (SDK) is made available to developers worldwide, to help create decentralized applications relying upon its blockchain. Their infrastructure, protocols and Master Nodes network are made available to third party apps with long term storage and data transmission needs. TERNOA TOKEN ECONOMY Moreover, only CAPS holders will be available to purchase Secret NFTs on the marketplace. A staking system will be launched after listing allowing CAPS holders to stake their token for a highly attractive APY rate. These CAPS will be either exchangeable with special NFT's, or vested until the main net launch. They use an NPOS, so nominators will be able to stake and delegate tokens to masternode's validator's operators in the consensus protocol, in exchange for a portion of the profitability of the Masternodes. Ternoa also thought of a burning process, where the tokens of a compromised masternode are seized from the corrupt Validator and part of the CAPS allocation will be allocated to the Ternoa Foundation, and the other part will be burned.

Knit.Finance is the world's first wrapped protocol for creating cross-chain wrappers for the top multi-class assets using Polkadot. 97% of Crypto assets which is close to 2 trillion Dollars still doesn't have access to all DeFi features. Holders whose Blockchain Assets do not support current DeFi operational architecture had to dump. This reduced the value of many non DeFi assets meanwhile much in DeFi is happening on the Ethereum chain, increasing gas prices and congestion. This resulted in considerably lower capital efficiency. Knit.Finance opens up the possibility of DeFi to many Non-ERC20 and Non-DeFi participant chains and different asset classes. With Multichain wrappers, KNIT creates a way for billions in liquidity to flow into different DeFi asset classes allowing any crypto holder to convert their assets into an equivalent insured wrapped token on any chain with the original asset being insured by real world insurance. Knit.Finance can be expanded to other asset classes like Tesla shares, Gold, bonds, etc. Hence, huge amount of assets can be moved into several blockchains to amplify DeFi. KNIT FINANCE MARKETING STRATEGY Knit.Finance is targeting user from: Chains driving liquidity to get more transactions happeningProjects driving liquidity to more activityProjects and Chains Staking to reduce free liquidity by stakingDeFi communitySocial media campaigns, strategic marketing partnersInfluencersMining/staking/yield farming activities Knit will also actively collaborate with existing loyal communities of various projects, chains and coins to raise market awareness and build a strong community.

In terms of attracting crypto gamers, they do not see this as a problem for several reasons: There is a current lack of originality in the type of games appearing on blockchain, both in terms of action and horror so gamers are hungry for ""real"" reasons to play crypto games rather than none-crypto games by developers entering the market with alternative games like their own.Its target audience fits with the age bracket of crypto gamers in general.They want to contribute to the adoption of blockchain for trading and holding real game assets, FEAR will be onboarding many of its existing gamers for free via airdrops while also running competitions for those recording videos of how to participate in the games via crypto and Fear coin.The NFT have multiple use cases throughout the game verse. It will collaborate with other high quality crypto games that meet their standards in terms of visuals, playability and originality with mutually useful NFTs that can be used in both game verses. FEAR will also run extensive social media and marketing campaigns to gain major brand exposure in the space quickly, on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram and Youtube. They plan a series of NFT airdrop contests for Twitter. A $FEAR coin airdrop contest and will approach influencers who are interested in working with FEAR while having their own NFT created and animated to appear in its game. Influencers will be as much an NFT specialist as crypto in general. They will also collaborate with horror artists and other high quality NFT art projects to have some of their work re-imagined and brought to life in their games. Turning static artwork on the blockchain into fully blown animated rich characters is a powerful lure they anticipate many projects will be keen to take up while in return they will gain new audiences and fans from those projects. This will peak the interest of many NFT collectors and artists to speculate on and collect its own assets. As its games are highly original with striking animations and contain never seen before scenarios in games, movies and animation, they have a strong impact and impression on new gamers. They tend to spread like wildfire due to their dark humour and crazy plots. WHAT MAKES FEAR NFT UNIQUE? Currently there are no competitors in the Blockchain NFT space. FEAR has no doubt casual action games are in demand with crypto gamers. Game sales in the US in 2018, the Action genre leads the way at the top of the table (view here). Coupled with this horror is a very powerful sub niche to tap into and is a hotly covered area with Youtube gamers. Marrying both genres together with its current brand will provide gamers with an irresistible mix and a gamer series hard to resist when farming and interacting with NFTs. To give you an idea of the sort of potential in the horror gaming market for PC and mobile gaming, here are some stats of indie horror developers and their revenue generation from just producing one or two games each of high originality. You could consider these games are indirect competitors (in the fiat realm) though all are very different from one another within the horror realm.

Whack Your Undead Neighbour: Android: 750k installs: 20,000 active players | PC: 7 million plays on Web  Your neighbour is the victim of a zombie outbreak and your next unless you find all the ways to defend yourself in your garden using typical everyday objects in not so typical ways! A point and click action game, Whack Your Undead Neighbour is a glorified zombie bloodbath staying true to the origins of its franchise - point, click and watch something outrageous happen. Its game is already live on the Google Play store and currently has 750,000 downloads. It receives between 800-2,000 installs per day. They are updating and rebranding the game to dramatically improve its performance. The web version of the game has received over 7 million plays so far across different web portals including its own. FEAR is re-developing the games in Unity, bringing more user retention from new content and improved performance both on desktops and mobile. The NFT and Blockchain Angle Each character in the game is a unique NFT you can own on the blockchain and comes with exclusive content no other gamer or collector can see except the owner. The owners details are also showcased when each character is hovered over within the game. NFT's from this game will be able to be carried over into Whack the Demon for multiple use cases. NFT farming will be introduced to Whack Your Undead Neighbour after it is successfully deployed in its second game Whack the Demon. FEAR further plans to develop the game to include skilled challenges and more in depth scenarios. The game will be available for PC, Android and iOS, though wallet and NFT integration will start solely with the PC version at the start. For NFT collectors ownership details will still be displayed in the mobile versions to maximise the value of such NFTs where mobile gamers still get to see the current collectors of the NFTs. Whack the Demon  Whack the Demon is the premium title they are developing that will feature in-depth puzzle and action game mechanics and an extensive range of demons you square off against and have to kill in brutal and ingenious ways. Each demon will feature many puzzle based ways to defeat it, some simple while others complex. The game will take on a new visual appearance while staying faithful to the feel of the traditional series. Survival mode will be an easy to play hard to master ""Play to Earn"" option where gamers with the most blood spilled and length of time endured before death will receive Fear coin prize pools on a weekly and monthly basis. On top of this rare and unique NFTs will also be rewarded. NFTs farmed in the traditional story mode can also be brought to survival mode to aid the gamers chances in finishing in the top spots of the high score board. The game is being developed for PC, Android, iOS and eventually Nintendo Switch, Xbox and Playstation consoles. A multiplayer cooperative mode is also being penned for the game where players will be able to work together in teams to achieve the best scores and win prize pools of Fear together. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY FEAR NFT? They are using Unity (the world's number one game development platform) to build their games while working with OpenSea to develop NFT ERC1155 farming contracts.FEAR has built its own internal system in Unity already to handle puzzle based point and click mechanics and an inventory system way beyond the capabilities of its previous games.They have also partnered with Gather Network to offer a first of its kind in the space reward program where players who simply spend time on its portal playing the games can earn Fear coin to use for NFT purchases.

Trade Race Manager is a brand-new blockchain-based crypto gaming experience powered by $IOI and #NFTs, where you can Race, Collect, Trade and Earn. IOI is making trading less stressful by adding gaming features in the form of NFT cars. The player fuels the NFT car with a crypto portfolio of their own choosing and races against other players’ crypto-preferences. The crypto-mix that performs best in real time, wins the race and grants access to the $IOI prize pool. Players earn $IOI tokens regardless of race outcome and can stake their $IOI while racing, so there are no losers. Soon, IOI will be launching an internal NFT marketplace, where players can trade NFTs like race cars, tracks, teams and avatars. IOI Wallet - a simple wallet to store all your Assets, such as cryptocurrency, IOI and NFTs.IOI TOKEN - Deflationary Multi-Utility Gaming Token. It functions as the platform's native currency and has various utilities and burning functions. Stake $IOI for up to 36% APY. Boast with Limited Edition NFT cars (only 200.000 cars available). IOI MARKETING STRATEGY The Covid pandemic and associated lock-downs lead to a boom in the gaming industry and especially in the demand for NFTs. The combined NFT market has a $8B capitalisation, including the foundations for building NFT games (Enjin, FLOW, WAX). The NFT gaming market is valued at $6B and has immense potential for future growth. IOI’s goal is to cover Asian markets, SAE territory and establish partnerships in Dubai. Their strategy is to co-operate with potential gaming partners for utilising cross-game NFT-features. This turns competition into potential partners. IOI is cooperating with many well-known influencers and Youtubers, with an average of 6-10 million views, who help the team to continuously find and build new partnerships. As a reward for early-birds, IOI is preparing many NFTs as special give-aways. WHAT MAKES IOI UNIQUE? IOI is developing a new gaming model — play2earn. Players are tired of the greedy pay2win model and IOI obliges, by providing earning incentives for simply playing Trade Race Manager, rather than winning races (of course the incentive is higher for winners).

Lever is the world's first AMM-based decentralized margin trading protocol. The idea of building Lever.Network came from the huge market opportunity the project observed in their research of DeFi. Though lending and trading as two of the pillar businesses in the DeFi space has the most TVL, these are practically isolated from each other, resulting in considerably low capital efficiency, which is not healthy for the future growth of DeFi. To resolve this problem, Lever is developed to bridge the gap between lending protocols and DEXes, and provide margin trading service for traders to amplify their gains. LEVER MARKETING STRATEGY To acquire its first users, Lever will focus on crypto audiences, especially DeFi users as they are more familiar with lending and margin trading which are popular among them. Besides relying on its strategic partners' marketing resources, Lever will also actively collaborate with existing communities and influencers to raise market awareness and build a strong community. Below explains Lever's marketing and operation strategy in details:  WHAT MAKES LEVER UNIQUE?  LEVER PRODUCT ROADMAP  LEVER REVENUE STREAMS  HOW DOES LEVER WORK? Currently Lever has 1 product with 2 features: For lenders/borrowers, they can lend their idle crypto assets (including their deposit certificates from other lending protocols, i.e. AAVE's aTokens and Compound's cTokens) to earn interest or use them as collateral to take out loans.And for traders, after making a margin deposit in the margin pool, users will be able to open either long or short positions on a supported asset in Lever with up to 3X leverage. The platform makes use of external AMMs like Uniswap to provide surplus liquidity for margin traders to open positions of any size. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY LEVER? The lending feature of Lever is based on the AAVE protocol while its margin trading, and liquidation feature are innovatively created by the Lever team. The execution of Lever's liquidation mechanism is featured with 0 costs and 0 delays. Compared with AAVE, Lever has its innovative improvement. The liquidation smart contract in Lever's protocol will be automatically triggered when it is called by liquidators. No upfront assets are needed from liquidators, making 0-cost liquidation possible. And compared with dYdX, Lever is able to provide greater liquidity for trades. It can provide the best trading experience regardless of position sizes. LEVER TOKEN ECONOMY LEV is the governance token of the Lever ecosystem with more additional value to be added in future development. 	2605	0.0007677543186180423	0.0011516314779270633	0.0011516314779270633
66	xcad-network	750000	91	DeFi	 DAO Maker 	 MarketMaker.io 	1.0	1.0	xcad-network	31/05/21	ethereum	18	5	WHAT IS XCAD NETWORK? Xcad Network is further monetizing existing content creators by allowing these creators to tokenize themselves and their content. Xcad has its own NFT Marketplace, specifically designed for content creators and their audiences, fiat gateways and easier options to store NFTs. The marketplace is home to NFT moments - NFT moments are certain segments of a content creator's videos that are captured and released as NFTs. The moments captured as NFTs have different tiers: Rare - Some of the most iconic moments of a creator's careerGold - For those ultra-special moments within creator's contentSilver - creator moments that are enjoyed, but may be less popularBronze - For the simple, everyday moments in a creator's video Users will then be given the opportunity to own these special moments by purchasing content creator packs containing them. Xcad sees a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between cryptocurrency and the real world, due to the mass reach of their current influencers and beyond. Xcad doesn't just support existing creators; the Xcad ecosystem also contains an online education platform consisting of a suite of tools for aspiring creators, created by Influencers with over 50 million followers combined, which will be entirely powered by the XCAD token. Xcad also enables advanced features that let influencers reward loyal viewers by allowing them to earn tokens as they engage with content without any changes to their existing workflow. Viewers can speculate on the future growth of creators by trading tokens of creators they think have potential, via the Xcad DEX. These tokens can be tracked via Xcad's InfluencerMarketCap.com, which will show live data of all creator tokens. Think of it as CHZ fan tokens or cryptocurrency for influencers. The more a creator grows, the more creator tokens will be burned, making them more scarce, so fan tokens will become more valuable due to supply and demand. Performance will allow creators to unlock vested tokens as they hit milestones governed by the Xcad community token holders. XCAD MARKETING STRATEGY Initial Phase - The initial phase will focus on onboarding content creators into the Xcad program, leveraging Xcad's contacts within the space. The first part of this is to allow content creators to create their own NFTs, including NFT moments which they can sell to their audience. Furthermore, NFTs in the form of customised artwork & badges will also be available within the Xcademy e-learning platform, and it will be possible for them to be purchased and attached to student profiles. Aggressive Crypto Community building will also be carried out during this phase. Development Phase - Phase two will be where they really start to bridge the gap between crypto and the real world, at a mass scale. Xcad will start to tokenize content creators directly on YouTube. A select batch of content creators will encourage their viewers to download a browser plugin. Once downloaded, the viewers will start to earn rewards for each time they watch the creator's content. Users will likely be unaware they are earning cryptocurrency. Growth Phase - Xcad will start to scale up the tokenization of content creators, allowing any creator to apply to the program. Xcad token holders will govern what content creators can be tokenized and be able to set the milestones for approved creators. For the first time ever, viewers will be able to speculate on the future growth of a content creator as they can buy or sell creator tokens directly within the plugin without the usual complex experience of buying crypto. Content creator tokens will be trackable via InfluencerMarketCap.com. Adoption - At this stage, the XCAD token will be required to use any of the services within the Xcad Ecosystem. A large number of XCAD tokens will be locked up in content creator liquidity pools as viewers will want larger rewards while consuming content. As tokenization of content creators reaches scale, it will become a disadvantage for creators to not pursue content tokenization, due to the watch time metrics attached to rewarding viewers. WHAT MAKES XCAD UNIQUE? As of today, other companies are attempting to tokenize online celebrities, however none have built a complete ecosystem around the tokenization of creators and their content, where both the fan and content creator win. Unlike most other platforms, Xcad plugs directly into existing social media and rewards users and creators for actions they already do on a daily basis; there is no change to their existing habits. The XCAD token has numerous uses beyond the simple purchase of creator tokens, in contrast to most tokenization projects.. Users can stake the asset with content creator tokens to earn a multiple on rewards, thus taking XCAD tokens off the market. Additionally, the token is used for governance and powers the entire Xcad platform. The token is required within the Xcad platform to purchase the entirety of it's services, providing real demand instead of relying on speculation. Furthermore, the XCAD token fuels the Xcad DEX, which is a decentralized exchange exclusively for content creator tokens where users can view each creator token's market capitalization and performance on InfluencerMarketCap.com. Xcad is targeted at the real world, unlike most crypto projects that simply target the crypto space. Xcad is trying to bridge the gap between the real world and crypto. Users won't need to jump through tons of hoops like creating long addresses or dealing with complicated exchanges. Everything will be user friendly within a browser extension so they can earn, stake, buy and sell creator tokens seamlessly right from their browser, as well as NFTs.  XCAD PRODUCT ROADMAP  XCAD REVENUE STREAMS  HOW DOES XCAD WORK? Vault - The Xcad vault allows XCAD holders to stake their XCAD tokens and LP shares to get rewarded for providing liquidity. DEX - A decentralised exchange similar to Uniswap will allow users to swap content creator tokens for XCAD tokens and then to USD. content creator tokens can ONLY be swapped for XCAD. Browser Plugin/Mobile App - This is a Google Chrome Plugin that content viewers will install to create a free Xcad account. Once set up, they will start earning content creator tokens for consuming tokenized content. Within the browser plugin, users also trade content creator tokens for stable coins, buy more content creator tokens or even XCAD tokens. Liquidity pools for staking will also be built into this plugin. Content creator Liquidity Pools - Viewers can stake content creator tokens with XCAD tokens in liquidity pools to earn multipliers on rewards earned when consuming their favourite creators content. This provides liquidity for those wanting to trade creator tokens. InfluencerMarketCap.com - Similar to the famous CoinMarketCap, a website full of data on how content creators' tokens are performing and other related data such as market caps, trading volumes and token metrics. E-learning platform - An online educational portal with multiple educational resources from some of the UK's biggest YouTubers on how to start your YouTube journey, as well as a set of tools and services which can only be purchased by using the XCAD token. NFTs - Non-fungible tokens designed and created by content creators of which fans and followers can purchase. NFT Exchange - A customised NFT exchange designed with the retail user in mind, rather than just the cryptocurrency native user. Fans can purchase unique and exclusive creator NFTs while also hosting the creator NFT Moments concept. Viewers will be able to purchase NFT 'packs' which consist of a variety of creator moments from videos, with more iconic moments being more scarce and super-fan collector items. The moments consist of the following different levels : Rare - For some of most iconic moments of a creator's careerGold - For those ultra special moments within the videoSilver - For those moments that are a little bit less specialBronze - For the basic moments in a creator's video. Xcad Governance portal - A portal where XCAD token holders can vote on the milestones that content creators unlock vested tokens. Xcad Toll - A white label solution by DAO Maker allows early supporters to unlock vested tokens early but for a penalty. If you choose to unlock a percentage of your tokens early, a penalty will be paid; the penalty tokens are then burnt and taken out of circulation. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY XCAD NETWORK? Ethereum Blockchain The TGE will take place on the Ethereum Blockchain, Ethereum is the most well known blockchain in the crypto world with the most liquidity and ease of access. Zilliqa Blockchain The Xcad application will use the Zilliqa blockchain as the core blockchain network. The Zilliqa blockchain has been live since January 2019 and is often cited as the world's most advanced sharded blockchain protocol; it will provide a secure, scalable, and affordable blockchain platform to meet the high transaction requirements. Zilliqa has an established and thriving decentralised application ecosystem with over 70 projects from 20+ countries building on the network with the support of a global community of 150,000 enthusiasts and a vast developer network. To date, the Zilliqa blockchain has processed in excess of 12 million transactions. Scilla (Smart Contract) The team is using Scilla for the XCAD and content creator tokens and NFT tokens. Scilla is an award-winning smart contract language created by Zilliqa and is a powerful type-safe functional programming language designed with smart contract safety in mind. Decentralised Exchange Xcad is building its own DEX, this is similar to UniSwap or Zilswap, where users can swap one asset for another; later, this will be added into the Xcad browser plugin. It will have all the same functionality as a standard UniSwap fork however it will only allow content creator tokens to be traded against the XCAD token. Cross Chain Interoperability Bridge (ZILLIQA, ETH) Due to scalability requirements, the Xcad application activity will occur on the Zilliqa blockchain. However, users will have the option to trade their XCAD tokens on the ETH and Binance blockchains due to the interoperability bridge being deployed by Zilliqa. React/Node JS The Xcad E-learning platform, Xcademy, is built in Node JS & React, as well as the Xcad Browser Plugin.

MakiSwap is an AMM and Yield Farming platform built on Huobi Eco Chain (HECO) and part of the growing UniLayer Ecosystem. MakiSwap is developed by the Unilayer founding team. Unilayer's sole purpose is to provide Blockchain Interoperability between Ethereum and HECO, MakiSwap will make things easier to seamlessly integrate all of the UniLayer DeFi tools on HECO. Here are the most popular UniLayer DeFi tools coming to HECO & MakiSwap: Limit Orders / Market OrdersUniLayer Launchpad ChartsAnalytics DEX AggregatorOrder booksStaking / Providing LiquidityCross chain - interoperability (Screen will change live on selection of a particular blockchain) All these trading tools powered by Unilayer will be natively integrated within the MakiSwap platform, making it the first AMM to have a more robust trading experience for both experienced and new traders. MAKISWAP MARKETING STRATEGY Currently traders are required to switch screens between CEX and DEX as both platforms provide different sets of functionalities. Makiswap will be the very first DEX that will have all functionalities of CEX enabled within. Makiswap's first target audience would be those people who are looking to have more passive income through farming, liquidity providing etc. Secondly, those people who look for a CEX / DEX with better liquidity and intend to place a Limit Order / Market Order for a buy / sell. Maki will complete the bridge between CEX and DEX and also enable cross chain functionality. Maki will become a one stop shop for a trader and investor. Maki is using various ways to attract people to the platform: Provide high yield farming opportunitiesProvide high yield liquidity poolsPartnership with leading blockchains (eg HECO, BSC, DOT) to enable interoperabilityBetter user experience with improved UI/UX and Maki platform functionalitiesEnlarging its community through various influencers over various social media platformsProvide great opportunities to retail investors to invest in Unilayer Launchpad which will be integrated with MakiswapEnable Staking and Margin Trading in V-2.0 WHAT MAKES MAKISWAP UNIQUE ? Currently, there is no integration between centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Precisely DEX such as Uniswap, Pancakeswap, Sushiswap, etc does not provide functions that a CEX does, such as Limit Order or Stop-loss Order. Traders or investors either have to wait for project listing on a centralized exchange or bear the heavy slippage offered by current DEXs. Trading experience on current DEXs is limited to only Buy / Sell at the offered price without allowing buyers & sellers to create orders at their own price range. There are many AMM without any special features being added on top of the numerous different forks from Uniswap. Current AMM are super simple and missing key features that are required by the audience. They are lacking very simple things like user-friendly tutorials on how to trade, how to add liquidity and many more difficult things. Besides the simple swapping and looking on a info page to track some tokens, Makiswap is heading a different way in terms of professionalism by giving the users tools that are included on trading on a CEX, but miraculously not available on a decentralized platform. And none of those platforms has plans to change this in the near future, Makiswap does by adding tools like: Limit Orders, Stop Limit Orders, charts, analytics, tutorials, on any feature offered and 24/7 live-chat, etc. Just only by integrating features that you can find on a CEX as default are now integrated for Makiswap.  MAKISWAP PRODUCT ROADMAP  MAKISWAP REVENUE STREAMS  TECHNOLOGIES USED BY MAKISWAP Huobi Eco Chain Huobi Eco Chain (Heco) is a decentralized and cost efficient public chain that Ethereum developers can easily get started with and smart contracts are seamlessly compatible.

In terms of attracting clients, it strives to become a go-to-platform for Blockchain and IT jobs by onboarding industry-leading blockchain firms and renowned exchanges with millions of users like Coinbase, Binance, Okex, FTT. In this way, they would be able to create awareness amount their huge userbase and at the same time this will help Ispolink to gain credibility and attract more prominent clients. WHAT MAKES ISPOLINK UNIQUE? In 2019, the global online recruitment market size was $ 28.68 billions and the projections estimate a CAGR of 7.1% in the next eight years, reaching $ 43.39 billions by 2027. Ispolink strives to bridge the huge gap that exists between the demand and supply for tech talents. The global ICT sector employs over 55 million people and is growing at a rapid pace, with 63 million employees expected by 2023. In Europe alone there are over 6 million engineers with about 20% of them changing jobs on an annual basis. One of Ispolink's key differentiators is the incorporation of AI, more specifically, implementing Machine Learning to match suitable candidates with unparalleled efficiency so that businesses can source talents on their own eliminating the need of using intermediaries. Essentially, the Machine Learning algorithm will analyze the job requirements of a published vacancy and it would match it against the existing pool of job seekers. On the other hand, when a person searches for jobs on the platform, the jobs would be arranged in relevance to the individual's competencies – a percentage of match rate would be displayed in order to aid the jobs seeker to identify suitable roles. This feature will further enhance the quality of applicants as users are unlikely to apply to positions ranked with a low percentage of match rate. Ispolink is redefining the established model – companies will be able to apply directly to candidates.  ISPOLINK PRODUCT ROADMAP  ISPOLINK REVENUE STREAMS  HOW DOES ISPOLINK WORK?  In the core of Ispolink's technology, the project is leveraging 3 main AI implications: 1. AI to parse CVs The AI derives and analyzes and the information from the CV of the candidate, and then it auto-fills it in the matchmaking algorithm in a suitable form. 2. ML Matchmaking algorithm which will match candidates based on the job description Ispoling will develop and train a Machine learning model which will help Companies to select the right Candidates based on the requirements listed in the job descriptions. More specifically, it is going to match candidates based on the following criteria: Work experienceTech stackJob-related skillsSoft skills Ispolink is going to utilize the information from the ML model to more accurately suggest potential hires for a job posting. When the ML model receives a job posting and a set of candidates, it's going to calculate the potential match rate for each Candidate in the set, based on the given job description. This information is going to be displayed in the search results along with the overall match rate. 3. AI to predict potential candidates for a position The 3rd AI use case will suggest candidates for a position based on similar jobs. For example, Google posts a job for a Java developer and hires a candidate through Ispolink. Based on the skills of the hired Java developer, Ispolink suggests candidates with similar characteristics for other Java positions by other companies. Now when Amazon publishes a Java developer position, Ispolink will extract the characteristics of the hired candidate by Google and suggest candidates with similar experience for Amazon. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY ISPOLINK? Ethereum Blockchain The project uses the Ethereum blockchain as the core blockchain network. The Ethereum blockchain has the highest number of users. Polygon L2 and Binance Smart Chain Both are used for the scalability of the platform and the facilitation of premium features. In-platform staking and On-chain analysis of applicants qualifications. NLP NLP is used for CV parsing, automated CV screening, internal AI matchmaking algorithms that connect companies and suitable candidates with just a few clicks.

Sienna Network is a privacy-first decentralized finance protocol built on Secret Network that enables trustless financial instruments, such as trading and lending with complete privacy with cross-chain support for Ethereum and soon Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Monero, and interoperability with all Cosmos blockchains via IBC. The first product, Sienna Swap, is a privacy-first front-running resistant AMM (Automated Market Maker) that allows you to swap tokens with complete privacy, thereby mitigating front-running. This means no one is able to see your trades and pending transactions. Privacy is an essential factor to the Sienna Network platform that leverages Secret Network, which allows for private smart contracts and private tokens similar to Monero and Zcash while having all the programmability of ERC20 tokens. Due to the inherent scalability of Secret Network, the blockchain Sienna Network is built on, gas fees are minimal and transactions instant. Users can also earn SIENNA via liquidity mining and other incentivization purposes. Upcoming products include a direct fiat gateway to buying SIENNA, a privacy-first lending protocol, tokenization of assets, and much more. The protocol is governed by the Sienna Token (SIENNA), which is a private SNIP-20 token running on Secret Network. Sienna Network also has a wrapped ERC20 token (wSIENNA) and will also have wrapped token versions for the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem, Polkadot, and more. SIENNA NETWORK MARKETING STRATEGY The market for privacy focused solutions is increasing rapidly these years. Sienna Network is targeting the market for privacy oriented DeFi applications by launching an AMM that is not only privacy preserving but also prevents front-running and is scalable, which means it has low gas fees. These three features are amongst the most requested features in the DeFi community. Sienna is doing two IDOs, which will build significant awareness about Sienna Network and the community. Awareness is amplified through a strong community and PR efforts. Partnering with KOLs is also an important factor for building awareness and engagement for Sienna Network. Users of Sienna Network are rewarded for using the protocol and can earn SIENNA that will enable them to vote for new proposals. This engagement of the users and community is important to secure a sense of ownership and relationship with Sienna as a platform. Partnerships While Sienna Network can exist as a stand alone platform, it is important to build partnerships with other players in the crypto community but also systemic players such as institutional investors and FinTech partners. Due to the privacy-preserving nature, Sienna is in a position to become the go-to-market platform for institutional players. Partnerships can include implementation to Card Payment Providers, Investment Banks, FIAT Gateways, Clearing Houses for Tokenized Assets (shares, bonds, etc), and much more. IBC - Inter Blockchain Communication - is an important factor for building partnerships in the crypto community, and will enable Sienna Network to provide additional value to the Cosmos ecosystem, which include Binance Wallet, Cosmos, Keplr, and much more. The token IDO for SIENNA is set to happen on the DAO Maker launchpad before listing on exchanges. Add DAO token to your portfolio to have a chance at allocations in the SIENNA token IDO. Make sure to follow Sienna to get the latest updates and participate in upcoming SiennaLove activities. Telegram Announcement Channel Twitter  WHAT MAKES SIENNA NETWORK UNIQUE? Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has seen immense growth in the last few years and shows no signs of slowing down. Wonderful use cases have already emerged and it has become apparent DeFi is here to disrupt Wall Street and beyond. Still, immediate problems need to be addressed in order for DeFi to truly flourish into trillions of dollars. Sienna Network realized some major problems that they wanted to tackle heads on in order to take DeFi to the next level. Aside from understanding, existing DeFi protocols are fundamentally flawed. Transactions are not private. Future trades can be seen by everyone prior to execution. Execution priority on Ethereum is driven by transaction fees. A transaction can be preempted by simply introducing a transaction and paying a higher transaction fee. This is known as front running and is illegal in the regulated financial system for good reasons. This exploitation has been in its prominence ever since DeFi surfaced. Programmable privacy allows feeding verifiable sensitive data into a decentralized world without revealing said data. Decentralized identities, credit scores, under-collateralized loans, privacy for institutions are a few to mention. Sienna is already in talks with major institutions about using Sienna Network as their platform of choice for DeFi. Sienna Network is aiming to become the de facto standard for privacy-first DeFi across multiple blockchain ecosystems such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos blockchains, and other chains in the future. Money should be private but also compliant so users are able to document their transactions if needed. Its focus is also on user experience and compliance to drive institutional adoption and partnerships with systemic FinTech players. Distributed IDs are crucial to obtain institutional compliance as they need to document a network of KYC-checked players.  SIENNA NETWORK PRODUCT ROADMAP  SIENNA NETWORK REVENUE STREAMS  HOW DOES SIENNA NETWORK WORK? Swap Swap your tokens with Sienna Swap. While being 100% private, Sienna Network also provides low transaction fees due to the inherent blockchain scalability Sienna utilizes from Secret Network. You can swap any private SNIP-20 token at Sienna Network. If you do not have private tokens yet, you can use the bridge to exchange your tokens for the private equivalent. You can always convert them back again. This will enable you to trade through Sienna Swap. An example of a pair is SIENNA + sDAI (secretDAI). Sienna Network is a pure SNIP-20 token, and sDAI is a bridged token to its ERC20 equivalent, the DAI stable coin token. The Pool Deposits at the Sienna Network pool are the foundation for the Automated Market Maker (AMM). By providing liquidity to a trading pair of tokens, you will help the exchange execute faster and better. In return, you will receive tokens and rewards. The AMM charges a total fee of 0.30% for executing a swap transaction. It is split by 0.28% in liquidity provider fee and 0.02% is converted into SIENNA and burned - in total 0.30%. This means, the more people use Sienna Swap, the more SIENNA tokens will be burned. You can earn 0.28% of your share of the daily volume by providing liquidity to a pair of tokens. Not only do you earn from it - you also contribute to the ecosystem and provide a tremendous amount of value to it. You can select one or multiple pairs of tokens you want to provide liquidity for and every time a swap is made, you receive your 0.28% proportionally to your share of the pool. Example: If your proportional share of the pool is $1 million out of $100 million, you will receive 0.28% of 1% of the daily swap volume. If the swap volume is $200 million, you will receive $6,000 per 24 hours for depositing to the swap pair pool. You can, of course, deposit a much smaller amount than $1 million. Rewards When you provide liquidity to the exchange, you will receive LP-tokens (liquidity provider tokens). LP-tokens have two main characteristics. You can use them to reclaim your liquidity or you can deposit them and receive additional rewards. Liquidity providers will receive a matching set of LP-tokens for the specific pair. Not all LP-tokens are eligible for rewards. Below is the list of the LP-tokens liquidity providers will be rewarded for: SIENNA / sSCRTSIENNA / sETHSIENNA / sUSDTsWBTC / sETH More token pairs eligible for rewards will be announced soon. A total of 2,000 SIENNA across all pairs will be rewarded to liquidity providers on a daily basis. A total of 3.6 million Sienna tokens will be granted as rewards over a four-year period. The reason for this gradual minting of the 3.6 million SIENNA governance token is to fairly distribute the token to the users of the platform by using Sienna Network as a platform, thereby having a fully autonomous organization in the future where token holders decide over Sienna Network. Bridge Convert your tokens into their private equivalent, where all transactions are completely private. This means ETH becomes secretETH. DAI becomes secretDAI. You can use these secret tokens to trade on Sienna Swap, or simply convert them back to their original state whenever you like. Currently there is support for Ethereum, but other bridges are launching soon (Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Monero and more). WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY SIENNA NETWORK? Blockchain: Secret Network Languages: Rust (Smart contracts), React (Front-end), JAMstack Framework: CosmWasm Secret Network is a blockchain protocol that enables decentralized applications to perform encrypted computations. Secret nodes utilize trusted execution environments (TEEs) to enable private computation over encrypted data with high security. The Rust code that enables applications to use private data is referred to as a ""Secret Contract"" on Secret Network. Secret Contracts are similar to smart contracts, such as those used with Ethereum. The key difference is that Secret Contracts can take encrypted inputs and produce encrypted outputs, without exposing any data while it is in use. In addition, a contract state (its internal, persisted database), remains encrypted throughout executions. Data on blockchains is public by default. This is a problem for applications that make use of sensitive information, such as user data, personally identifiable information (PII), votes, or moves in a game like rock-paper-scissors or poker. The Secret Network aims to solve this problem by enabling data-in-use privacy through private computation for decentralized applications. ﻿SIENNA NETWORK TOKEN ECONOMY "	10154	0.0032499507583218434	9.848335631278314e-05	0.000689383494189482

Smoothy Finance has several unique features that Curve can hardly offerSingle pool for all stablecoins (e.g., 20+ stablecoins in a pool) with interest earning, which results in better liquidityCollaterals to add/remove stablecoins in the poolLow-slippage and extremely low gas fee even with interest-earning  SMOOTHY FINANCE PRODUCT ROADMAP  SMOOTHY FINANCE REVENUE STREAMS  WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY SMOOTHY FINANCE? 1) Novel bonding curve invented by Smoothy.finance Smoothy.finance invents a new swap called SmoothSwap, which designs a novel bonding curve that. Offer 1:1 swapping if the pool is balanced, i.e., the percentages of the tokens are within predefined rangesIncur a penalty (derived from the bonding curve) if the pool is unbalanced The mathematical derivation of the bonding curve and its smart contract implementation is completely invented by Smoothy Finance. 2) Single pool supporting multiple stablecoins with better liquidity Unlike Curve, which supports up to 4 stablecoins in one pool, Smoothy can support multiple stablecoins in one single pool, and can flexibly add/remove any token. Theoretically, Smoothy can accommodate hundreds of different types of stablecoins in one pool (even algorithm stablecoins). This means that Smoothy will not suffer from the fragmented liquidity of multiple pools, enabling better liquidity. 3) Maximum LP reward achieved by Dynamic Cash Reserve Algorithm With reference to the bank's reserve system, they designed a unique Dynamic Cash Reserve Algorithm, which dynamically allocates the majority of funds in the underlying interest-earning platform and the rest is reserved to meet daily swap needs. In other words, in addition to governance token earnings, liquidity providers can gain swap fees together with interest earning and lower gas fee. 4) Reduce the gas cost significantly by algorithm optimization Even deployed on Ethereum, the gas fee required by stablecoin swap on Smoothy is reduced by 90% compared to Curve's yPool and mStable after the algorithm optimization. It achieves a lower gas fee without using layer2 and ensures composability.

74	hord	145000	72	DeFi	other	 Kairon Labs 	0.0	0.0	hord	23/04/21	ethereum	55	4	WHAT IS HORD? Hord is a protocol to create and trade ETFs, also known are tokenized baskets. There are two key participants in Hord: (a) Champions and (b) their Hord. The Champions are likely to be market-leading influencers, funds, or strategy-based long-term traders. Champions broadcast their portfolio data, which is used by their Hord. There are two key smart contracts in Hord: (a) Champion Contract and (b) Mirror Contract. The first one serves Champions and the second one serves their Hord (followers). The Champion Contract is a smart contract that broadcasts the Champion's portfolio data to the Mirror Contract. The Champion's Hord can deposit funds to a Mirror Contract, which always acquires the assets in the proportion represented by the Champion's portfolio. Once funds are in the Mirror Contract, a token is minted to reflect its deposits, and it is then distributed too the accounts that deposited funds to the Mirror Contract. This token is essentially the tokenized portfolio of the Champion, and is redeemable for the underlying value held in the Mirror Contract. The ETF tokens can be traded on the Hord DEX, an orderbook decentralized exchange. HORD GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY Hord is conducting an Initial Champion Offering, a token offering in which the project has acquired the genesis roster of Champions, which include leading influencers and funds who will operate on Hord as Champions. The existing user base of these Champions will provide a key go-to market for Hord's initial phase. Hord has received considerable interest from both influencers and funds. This is the only protocol of its kind and is tailor-made to the social buying status of the crypto industry, where the primary buy power leads to a few Champions (market leaders). Hord creates double-edged benefit for both categories of participants: Champions are able to earn from the success they share to their Hord (followers), and their Hord is able to seamlessly and cost-effectively be in absolute sync with the Champion's portfolio. HORD PRODUCT VIABILITY Protocols for tokenized portfolios already exist, but they are static. Projects like Sets, DEXTF, dHedge, and their many forks all produce ETFs that can never be changed. Crypto is a hyper-volatile market. Any portfolio that must forever remain the same is practically useless in this market. Furthermore, the protocols lack a proper market target: Hord serves the specific market segment of Champions (market leaders) and their Hord (followers). Furthermore, Hord does not rely on AMMs to create liquidity for the ETFs. Instead, the internal orderbook DEX makes price matching possible without causing extreme slippage for large trades. It also does not force the community to act as liquidity providers that must commit ETH to create a market. Traditional ETFs, even the largest ones like the SPY ($350B), are malleable. The weights of assets they carry change; the assets they carry change. That's for a market not nearly as volatile as crypto. Hord recognizes the need for dynamic ETFs that must change their asset weights and holdings at a spontaneous rate, and hence delivers the tokenized barket protocol suited to the crypto market, all the while making the trading of these ETFs incredibly efficient and low-cost.  HORD PRODUCT ROADMAP  HORD REVENUE STREAMS  HORD PRODUCT DIVE Hord ETF (tokenized basket) Hord tokenized baskets can be changed in real-time, and enable Champions (market leaders) to build a portfolio that easily adjusts to the volatility of the crypto market. Hord Mirror The Mirror Contract enables a Champion's Hord (followers) to easily and cost-effectively adjust to the portfolio of the Champion (market leader). It socializes the asset adjustment fees (possibly reducing them by 99%), automates synchronization, and issues ETFs that reflect the portfolio value in real-time. Hord DEX The Hord DEX is an orderbook decentralized exchange that avoids the capital inefficiencies of AMMs, while generating fees for the protocol at fee levels much lower than AMMs. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED AND CREATED BY HORD ?

Micro-influencers can use the NFT creator tool to mint NFT ""badges"", share links to their fans on social media, and earn revenue from the sale of their badges. Fans, on the other hand, receive a digital NFT with artwork that they can display on their profile or trade. Influencers can donate a portion of the sale of their badges to various charities, which are displayed publicly. Showcase is designed to facilitate mass adoption and ease of use but retains fully decentralized non-custodial NFT ownership. SHOWCASE GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY On the token side, Showcase is working with crypto influencers who will promote the token. They are working with a marketing team run by Garlam, a well-known personality in the space. On the product side, they have cultivated relationships with influencers for over a year, and have hundreds of influencers pre-registered to use the app. Showcase will work with influencers to onboard them on the platform, educate them about NFTs, and help them create their first badge. It is an educational process with non-crypto influencers, many of whom currently sell t-shirts or take donations. WHAT MAKES SHOWCASE UNIQUE? The addressable market is Influencer Monetization. This includes sponsored posts, custom merchandise platforms, and donation platforms. Showcase believes that the product benefits both influencers and fans more than existing monetization solutions. Influencers would receive more revenue than if they were to sell physical merchandise and pay for manufacturing and shipping. Fans can share their status as early adopters to their friends 24-7, these are not limited by the size of their wardrobe. Compared to donations, fans are more incentivized to contribute. The recent interest in NFTs among the broader public on social media will undoubtedly help make the onboarding process for users and influencers easier. In terms of product design, the team studied existing marketplaces and social media applications and took inspiration from them and their user journeys. Showcase differentiates from NFT art platforms and considers their NFTs to be a digital form of collectable merchandise versus high art.

Cere Network is part of the consortium of projects from Polkadot and Cosmos, united by the vision of cross-chain interoperability (cross communications) between blockchain networks and serve the purpose of a trustless, and scalable global decentralized ecosystem for all businesses and consumers. Cere Network offers the world's first Customer Relation Management (CRM) blockchain ecosystem in a Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) optimized for service data integration and data collaboration, built on the scalable and heterogeneous platform of Polkadot. This DDC allows stakeholders to own and manage their data with full custody, making it the first platform that gives them 100% control over any data use or deployment. Enterprises now have the opportunity to easily plug in their existing applications and power of contextually relevant data, insights, and predictive analytics in real-time to supercharge their value streams via DDC. Cere's approach towards enterprise data holds similarities with successful cloud data platform Snowflake in providing direct access to first-party customer data. Cere takes this new narrative a step further through anonymizing and encrypting (individual-level) customer data through blockchain, which in turn can be exchanged with business partners and analyzed on Cere's open and on-demand data marketplaces. Cere makes data directly accessible in near real-time by all business units, partners/vendors, and machine-learning processes. This in turn enables secure and private data collaborations through Cere's Open Data Marketplace (ODM) which is free from any traditional vendor lock-ins used by organizations like Salesforce, Oracle & Adobe. CERE NETWORK GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY Cere's vision is to lead blockchain adoption for enterprises by using their own, unleashed customer data. Cere is the missing link for enterprises to successfully realize blockchain adoption. Cere offers fully integrated data solutions, aligned with the currently used SaaS platforms in the CRM marketplaces. Cere is deployed to bring immediate efficiency optimizations and cost savings in core business processes. The plug-and-play onboarding process of Cere is designed for fluent implementation in the existing systems of enterprises, it enhances the power of contextually relevant data insights, and predictive analytics in real-time to supercharge the enterprise value streams via the DDC. It establishes a secure first-party data foundation in the cloud by using blockchain identity and data encryption to onboard and segment individual consumer data. The implementation of Cere ignores traditional high start-up costs and set-up time while allowing enterprises the opportunity to go beyond their current data solutions with complete data ownership. WHAT MAKES CERE NETWORK UNIQUE? To usher in a new era of customer data interoperability and data agility, the Cere DDC has been purpose-built with customer data privacy and anonymization from the ground up. The DDC provides a secure foundation for the next generation of customer cloud data solutions to cleanly abstract PII and fully encrypt individual data for both privacy compliance and near real-time personalization. While initially set out to build a next-generation CRM solution to break the ""walled garden"" created by companies like Salesforce, the Cere team saw a much bigger opportunity in the data cloud platform while working with Fortune 1000 pilot customers to build a viable decentralized alternative to Snowflake. Cere's Decentralized Data Cloud facilitates plug-and-play customer onboarding that leverages identity abstraction technology, achieving the much sought-after GDPR & CCPA compliance for enterprises by design.  CERE NETWORK REVENUE STREAMS  WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED AND CREATED BY CERE NETWORK? Cere has built its Decentralized Data Cloud Platform from the ground up internally. Cere's Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) is a Snowflake-like intelligent data warehousing tool that captures customer sessions into a secure customer journey, creating a source of truth that can be extracted, transformed and loaded (ETL'd) into application-specific data views. Cere DDC allows big brands and enterprises to start establishing their data ecosystems and first-party data strategies. Cere's vision is to lead blockchain adoption for enterprises by using their own, unleashed customer data. Cere achieves this by providing stakeholders in these data ecosystems with 100% control over who can use their data and for what purpose in any particular context. Cere's approach towards enterprise data holds similarities with successful cloud data platform Snowflake in providing direct access to first-party customer data. Despite Snowflake's technology already being conveyed as game-changing, Cere takes this new narrative a step further through anonymizing and encrypting customer data, which in turn can be exchanged with business partners and analyzed on Cere's open and on-demand data marketplaces. The new realm of decentralized data interoperability will disrupt classic customer data applications even further. Through data- interoperability, enterprises can unleash the data they have in their data ecosystems and share this data seamlessly with their business partners. These new ecosystems propagate data-openness, which will spawn new business applications and use cases, which will benefit enterprises and ultimately customers. CERE NETWORK TOKEN ECONOMY $CERE is a utility token powering a transformative enterprise data framework. The token fuels the Cere Open Data Marketplace and SaaS-DeFi ecosystem. Next to its utility role, the $CERE token is used for Proof-of-Stake consensus and network governance. It's a token that will facilitate real-world enterprise demand by mapping tokenization and ease of exchange to SaaS utility and fees (B2B), as well as business-to-consumer payments , value transfers and NFT applications (B2C).

Crowny has created a new platform to help solve some of the current dilemmas within the world of advertising. Crowny is a platform that will allow brands to create effective campaigns and reach their target audiences with ease and simplicity. These users are enticed to listen to their message by being rewarded through the app. Users will be able to connect to their favourite brands through the Crowny Mobile App , without the risk of privacy breaches. What Crowny offers: A smartphone app which enables users to specify their areas of interest and allows them to follow their favourite brands. This gives them control over the type of content and deals they wish to see, and when they want to see it.A secure and private experience via the anonymization of user data.The possibility to reach out to consumers in several ways, including push notifications, geofencing and QR codes. The supplied content also includes interactions and gamification elements. Consumers will be more engaged than ever, which in turn will improve the consumer-brand relationship.Users will always be rewarded. Not only through the offers they receive, but also for consuming content; paid with $CRWNY tokens and brand loyalty points The biggest challenges of the advertising world includes reduced exposure, increasing costs, and elusive audiences. They are solving these challenges with their platform. Crowny also offers a free loyalty system to small business owners. The most interesting part of this loyalty system is the $CRWNY token. These rewards play a key role in the Crowny platform. Tokens can eventually be converted to (fiat) currencies, used to purchase products, or set aside as can be held in a wallet. CROWNY GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY The Crowny platform can be used by any company to reach out to their (potential) customers. User numbers are important, but advertisers are looking for their customers. For Crowny it is important to have focus. As a Go-To-Market strategy, They are starting with the crypto-world. Companies operating in this field have only limited ways to reach out to their users. Crowny will make a difference by connecting crypto-minded users with the Crowny App. The App plays a role in the whitelisting process for the IDO and will continue to provide the crypto community with relevant information, matching the preferences of the users. On the other side, companies will utilize its platform to connect and engage with users that exactly match their target groups. When first entering the app, all users will have to input several preferences, allowing Crowny to have some basic data about the users, even the ones from outside of the crypto world. As the user base and data grows, they believe this data will become relevant to non-crypto companies. Most importantly, the Crowny platform will always respect users preferences and personal privacy and never share it with other parties. As a feature of their core product, the Crowny App, companies can reach out to customers and reward them for interacting with their brand. This allows companies to easily always find, connect, and engage with their target audience. The Crowny free loyalty system allows every company to start a loyalty program for free. This free loyalty system comes with a very nice to have up-sell: companies using the free loyalty system can reach out to the clients that have accepted their loyalty points, which is a powerful way to keep in touch with existing customers. The free loyalty system allows us to also easily grow in the non-crypto world. CROWNY PRODUCT VIABILITY When a lot of people hear about the rewarding capabilities of Crowny, they think of Brave, but there are many differences. Crowny provides a free loyalty system, allowing interaction between brands and consumers.. The possibility for users to engage both on and offline is far more superior by using Crowny. Another important element is that they are building on Solana and have several reasons to do so. They are doing so because of it's incredibly cheap and fast transactions. These features will allow us to instantly reward via fast transaction speeds, allowing for an even better customer experience.  CROWNY PRODUCT ROADMAP  CROWNY REVENUE STREAMS Crowny's business model consists of 3 streams: A small base price per trigger/campaign an advertiser creates, a fee each time a user interacts with the content, and a 10% fee when it distributes content to a third party network.  CROWNY PRODUCT DIVE To use Crowny, both companies and users will have to make an account on the platform. After completing the registration process, they are ready to make use of the Crowny platform. Loyalty System The loyalty system Crowny offers to registered companies serves as a stepping stone for the advertising portal, but is nonetheless valuable for both companies and consumers. It provides companies a very easy way to incorporate a loyalty system into their business, completely free of charge. Advertising Portal Companies can log in into the 'Advertising Portal' to create an advertising campaign. Here, they will find all the features needed to create and launch a successful campaign. These features include (but are not limited to) real-time campaign overviews, data analysis tools, and preset campaigns based on the type of company/business. Just like the loyalty system, the 'Portal' is wrapped in an interface meant to be easy for even the least tech-savvy person. Mobile application The mobile application is a user-facing tool to interact with the Crowny platform. It keeps track of all the loyalty points earned for every user and groups them into a single simple interface. It also serves as a wallet for the $CRWNY tokens which are gained by interacting with brands. Crowny has implemented features to give the users total control over what messages they will receive and the frequency those messages are sent with. WHAT ARE TECHNOLOGIES USED AND CREATED BY CROWNY?  CROWNY TOKEN ECONOMY Token utility The $CRWNY token will first launch on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. They will be using the Wormhole bridge to Solana to support the functionalities on its platform. Crowny has developed the following token structure to serve both the platform users and the crypto community. 	6290	0.0014308426073131955	0.0	0.0030206677265500795

Where can you follow the wallets of the most successful crypto traders whilst also mirroring their trades automatically? Alphr is democratizing crypto investing. Alphr is building a decentralized social trading platform with automated mirror trading. Alphr allows users to follow the wallets of the most successful crypto traders: buy when they buy and sell when they sell. On Alphr wallets become social profiles. Every ETH wallet that trades on Uniswap already has a profile automatically generated from their trades, this allows users to copy the trades of any wallet address not just users who have signed up to use the platform. Each wallet address will have its own unique risk score on Alphr based on their trading history, enabling users to make quicker and smarter decisions about which wallets to mirror. The platform is attractive to smaller traders who are currently priced out of the market because automated mirror pool route funds together in a single transaction, saving users gas fees. Every time a wallet's trade is copied, they earn ALPHR tokens. Even if a user hasn't claimed their Alphr profile yet they are earning rewards when being mirrored. This serves as an excellent user acquisition tool. The ALPHR token holders receive 100% of the transaction fees which are returned back to them through a burn mechanism. The ALPHR token is a governance token that controls the community development fund. Conceptually Alphr is visualizing the Blockchain in a whole new way. The process of following wallets and interacting with a daily feed of their recent transactions provides a new kind of social experience for crypto traders. Alphr is launching with mirror trading on Uniswap and Ethereum, but soon users will be able to mirror cross chain with trades on BSC, Polkadot and more. ALPHR MARKETING STRATEGY The first users will inevitably be its token holders who are all traders themselves. Alphr already has active audiences on both Twitter and telegram waiting to use the product. It will be leveraging its extensive influencer partnerships who hold upward of an accumulative 4M followers on their social channels twitter, telegram, youtube, discord and tik tok. These partnered influencers will be sharing Alphr marketing content leading up to and after the IDO launch. The first users will inevitably be its token holders who are all traders themselves. It has a series of AMA's lined up before and after IDO some of which include: BaconDAO discord, Crypto DAKU. Alphr protocol rewards will also assist as a go to market strategy. There will be 3,000,000 Alphr tokens distributed to protocol users daily for 3 years. 2339.72 Alphr tokens per day. Half of each transaction fee is attributed to the person who performed the trade and half to the wallet who is being mirrored. Successful wallets that are being mirrored will automatically incentivise users to use Alphr and claim their token distribution. WHAT MAKE ALPHR UNIQUE ? The huge surge in DEX volumes and proliferation of DeFi protocols has enabled Alphr to exist. When the best traders in the world start to trade on DEXs this makes all of their trades transparent and available on chain. This means it's now possible to see who, for example, is the best performing WBTC trader in the last 90 days on Uniswap. You can then use that information to buy and sell WBTC when that trader does. Alphr enables you to do that, either manually or automatically using AMT (Automated mirror trading) Alphr turns every wallet that has ever traded on Uniswap (and soon to be all DEXs) into a social profile. You can see net worth, return, risk score, current tokens held and much more. Follow profiles and see a feed of recent transactions by wallets you're following. (User interface available in litepaper) With the explosion of DeFi your wallet has quietly become your social identity on chain. Discovering other wallets and seeing which new platforms they are trading/farming on, and which tokens they are buying and when, is becoming an important part of crypto trading. There is already a demand for this type of onchain discovery and trade copying, but currently traders are using a combination of Nansen (or similar tools), Telegram bots and manual trading to achieve what Alphr automates in one platform. Alphr is De-Fi's missing piece, a DeFi super app that connects it all. It enables you to visualize and discover the blockchain in a whole new way.  ALPHR PRODUCT ROADMAP  ALPHR REVENUE STREAMS  HOWD DOES ALPHR PRODUCT WORK ? Alphr's core features include: Your wallet as a social profile: Your wallet is your on-chain identity; Alphr makes it into a social profile. Every ETH wallet that trades on Uniswap already has a profile automatically generated from their trades.Visualize the Blockchain in a whole new way: Follow wallets and see a feed of their recent transactions, so you can manually mirror trades of your choosing in one click.Automated Mirror Trading: Create an automated mirror pool to automatically copy any wallet.ALPHR Token Value Capture: 100% of the transaction fees are returned back to ALPHR token holders through a burn mechanism.

ORAO uses a reputation system that judges data providers on factors like the freshness of data provided, order completion rates, quick fulfillment of tasks, etc. But through the integration of Data Protocols Orao can also judge providers on data normalization, and through the harnessing of Machine Learning it is able to make its reputation system proactive rather than reactive. With other platforms, an attacker is able to build up a good reputation score, only to deliberately provide false data if they can somehow benefit more from their trickery than they stand to lose from having their staked tokens confiscated. ORAO's system however analyzes data as it comes in, and even seasoned data providers are not blindly trusted if the data they provide goes too much against recent outputs, by the same provider or by others. ORAO also vastly expands the range of data that can be traded on the platform. There are by now a dozen oracles buyers can tap into for financial data. Bitcoin price feeds on-chain have been with us for going on five years. But through ORAO's predefined Data Protocols data providers can sell anything from soccer game outcomes to weather data to information about movies from IMDB. Because of how they built its platform, new Data Protocols can be added as demand is identified by buyers and providers. For anything that you can reasonably nail down an objective, verifiable answer, ORAO can support a Data Protocol for it and create a market. Lastly, ORAO is blockchain agnostic. It has been built for Polkadot, and so can support cross-chain interactions between anything from Ethereum to EOS to Zilliqa. Any compatible chain can be connected to ORAO as demand rises. ORAO MARKETING STRATEGY ORAO is targeting every single dApp/user and expanding ""what is possible on the blockchain"". It is built on Polkadot and opens a whole new set of possibilities for the types of services still NOT running on the blockchain. Alongside fueling financial and DeFi data types, is able to deliver Esports data, environmental (insurance/risk assessment), travel (bookings) and much more. its go-to-market strategy is: Initial marketing and brand recognition Community building through engagement, medium articles, partnerships, PR and most importantly influencers. Successful TGE and best practices launch with the support from top-tier platforms. Product market fit Understanding the existing landscape is a crucial step in order to ensure a good product market fit. There are an abundance of existing oracle solutions, however they all come with different problems such as limited data type availability, data inaccuracy, blockchain compatibility issues, performance/latency problems or lack of computation service. While ORAO solves all of these, pain-points segregation and analysis will help it identify which of these problems are the most significant and thus ensure maximum impact with each release. Partnership Network & Business Development Orao will engage in partnerships with leading industry players. This will ensure recognition, initial implementations and exposure. We also plan to onboard a significant business development team which will lead this effort. Growth Simple to use solutions (high-quality UX/UI, mobile support, simple SDK, high quality documentation, live support, retention team)Grants to products and solutions for integrating ORAOHackathons to encourage development on top of ORAOCommunity engagement activities and ambassador programMaterial translation and multi-language supportAdditional exchange listings WHAT MAKES ORAO UNIQUE ? dApps are constantly increasing their demand for data. They are limited to the type of data they can buy which forces them to build their own oracles and maintain those systems. There are specific oracles for specific blockchains. Some existing oracle companies announced support for other blockchains but they have failed to deliver yet. On top of that, none of them are architecturally able to provide general data, all are based on crypto pricing. Another advantage of ORAO is the proactive data rating - accuracy is computed as the data enters the system, before it's delivered to the end dApp/user. Orao taps into any dApp, company or end-user looking for accurate and ready-to-use-data. Data agnostic.ORAO supports general data.Cross-blockchain.Data rating and provider reputation.ORAO is proactive in its data rating rather than reactive.Compute functionality.

It is a set of cross-chain smart contracts, which are embedded into DeFi products and therefore facilitate new high levels of security. This is the first project launching from the Hacken Foundation, which will manage the business development direction for HAPI. Moreover, to ensure the continual development and safety of the platform, the tech team has received in-depth due diligence. HAPI MARKETING STRATEGY Blockchain hackers stole $3.8 billion in 122 attacks in 2020, of which $3 billion were smart contracts exploits. Hapi's primary market focus is DeFi protocols because of the vital need to secure the large amount of US dollars locked in those protocols (The Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols has risen from $0.6 billion in January 2020 to $40 billion as of today). The goal is to become the on-chain cybersecurity protocol of the DeFi space. Initial Phase: The project will focus on top DeFi protocols, and increasing their security. In this phase, the project is also building up a strong community for the Public Sale, introducing HAPI to different DeFi protocols, and forming alliances with prestigious projects like Hacken. These strategic partners will foster greater awareness of the project. Development Phase: Going-mainstream phase throughout the development of Cybersecurity Oracles and Smart Contract protection, HAPI will be integrated into many DeFi protocols on the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Solana Networks, rapidly increasing both its levels of adoption and revenues. Growth Phase: Scale-up protocol acquisition, through partnerships and intensive business development, HAPI will become the standard on-chain cyber security protocol for DEXs, lending protocols, derivatives protocols and other DeFi classes, reaching mass adoption and the profitability stage. WHAT MAKES HAPI UNIQUE? HAPI works in a way that sees the oracle notify, whether the smart contracts have had an audit or not. They then select the information that will be issued by the selected data providers and chosen by token holders. The HAPI DAO will then select the main data provider. The auditor of a smart contract will upload data on a conducted audit into the provider's database and the information will be transferred to the HAPI smart contract. So for every time a DEX user selects a token to trade, the exchange will then request their smart contract to check the audit status. If the token is not audited, the exchange will then notify the trader of the risks and can even impose limits to buy/sell of the order or even restrict the purchase of the token. Hapi Key Features: Built for the most popular blockchains (Ethereum, Polkadot, BSC, Solana, etc)All DeFi projects will increase their security by adding the HAPI moduleThey vote on data provider via DAOThe cost of reputational loss to a Data Provider will be significantly higher than the potential damage caused by false dataData will be on-chain, publicly availableThe ability to request to change or add additional data will have fees  HAPI PRODUCT ROADMAP  HAPI REVENUE STREAMS Data submission fee Provides rights for the customer to submit any information connected with the hack or suspicious wallet. DeFi projects audit report submission DeFi projects will legitimize their code by submitting it to a unified audit reports data centre. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY HAPI Ethereum Network HAPI uses the Ethereum blockchain as their core blockchain network. This blockchain has the largest ecosystem of DeFi protocols for implementing HAPI solutions. Solidity Hapi is using this high-level programming language for the smart contract development.

Aluna Social is a gamified social trading terminal that rewards top traders monetarily and reputationally, enabling beginners to learn from and auto-copy expert traders. The core goal behind Aluna Social is to gamify finance and redefine social trading for the Web 3.0 world. It does this by combining an intuitive and easy to use trading platform with an online social space built on transparency, gamification and sentiment analysis. Ultimately, giving users actionable data that is genuine and trustworthy. Users of Aluna Social can: Build their trader reputationGet Insights and tips from Aluna's top tradersFind the best traders to follow, copy and counter-copyGet rewarded with Aluna (ALN) tokens for creating value for the Aluna ecosystem The ALN token fuels the Aluna Social ecosystem. It can be used to earn incentives, spent against monthly subscription fees, play prediction games, stake, farm, and govern. ALN is also fairly distributed, community-owned and self-governed. WHAT MAKES ALUNA SOCIAL (ALN) UNIQUE? The concepts of copy-trading, prediction games, and social networks are not new to the crypto space, but Aluna Social will integrate them in a polished UX, adding trust and transparency to trading, as well as gamification mechanics to incentivise users to play games and trade assets in its ecosystem. Aluna.Social platform also evolved the concept of copy-trading to include counter-trading, where followers can execute contrary trades to the traders they follow. Furthermore, Aluna's novel prediction gaming mechanisms combine some of the primitives of curation and prediction markets with social trading. These games incentivise users to provide accurate and meaningful market and sentiment data by rewarding the best traders and most accurate predictions while minimising noise. This data can be aggregated and analysed over time — enabling users to make more informed trading decisions. The ALN token will be used to support the Aluna Social ecosystem. ALN is community-owned and self-governed through the Aluna DAO. ALN tokens can be earned as rewards, spent against monthly subscription fees, to play prediction games, stake, farm, and govern. Part of the revenue generated from ALN-powered products is burned.  ALUNA SOCIAL (ALN) PRODUCT ROADMAP ALUNA SOCIAL (ALN) REVENUE STREAMS The business model is split into two streams: Subscription fees for the Aluna.Social trading terminal and DeFi System fees coming from DeFi social trading. Subscription fees can be paid in ALN with a discount, and they will be redistributed to token stakers.  ALUNA SOCIAL (ALN) TECHNOLOGIES USED BY THE PROJECT  ALUNA SOCIAL (ALN) MARKETING STRATEGY The primary commercial goals are: To reward accomplished crypto traders (financially and reputationally) and simplify their trading experienceTo give newbie traders a copy-trading platform that has verifiable trading data and game-based inter Aluna Social USPs: Manage multiple exchange accounts from a single interface: Rather than expend effort on learning the nuances of UI and functionality across multiple exchange platforms, users can manage all their exchange accounts and trading from a single interface. In addition, they can analyse and monitor the market with the built-in screener tool and news feed.Trading transparency & Rewards: Successful traders can be reliably identified via public profiles displaying the verified trading history and real-time trades. In other words, 'expert' traders can put their money where their mouth is by using their profiles as a trust pass and get rewarded as a result. Newbie traders, on the other hand, can make informed trading decisions and copy trades of experts based on facts rather than social hype or promises.Gamification: Aluna provides a wealth of curated sentiment data based on innovative prediction gaming structures. The community's inclinations, history and forward-looking direction are all visible, smoothing the learning curve for new traders and impacting the behaviour of more accomplished traders. Initial Phase: Onboard experienced traders (including Influencers) and introduce participation mining, display campaigns, and community growth campaigns to build a loyal community of traders and investors in the Token Sale. Raise funds in Seed Sale to support these activities. Development Phase: Integrate Bitmex and other centralised and decentralised exchanges, launch platform tools, audit platform security and smart contracts, release Pro Subscriptions, Liquidity Mining, Governance (Aluna DAO), Staking & Holder Benefits. Expansion Phase: Ramp up user acquisition through trading competitions, NFT giveaways, participation mining, prediction games and DeFi Social trading. To further bootstrap liquidity and utility of the native ALN token, attract a larger audience, and incentivise meaningful contribution, we will introduce liquidity mining, ROI farming, and Rewards Pool.

The problem is that distributing tokens when adoption is low, creates an excess supply & devalues the economy. There is no link between the release of network supply and the network's adoption. This harms longer-term users and only favours short-term participants. Dafi introduces the first alternative since Bitcoin, to use network rewards for building a decentralized economy. Instead of directly issuing tokens for staking & liquidity – Dafi ties synthetics to each network's adoption. This means that the token release & network demand is proportional. Meaning users are still incentivized when adoption is low, but by being rewarded later, not earlier. By linking these two factors, it attracts longer-term users to be incentivized longer, supporting adoption. Dafi enables every protocol and platform to create a synthetic flavor from their native token. This is then algorithmically pegged to the demand of their network and distributed to users. Synthetic dTokens on Dafi can be created by projects and distributed to their users for Staking, Nodes, Liquidity, or even Participation/Bounty rewards. Individuals can stake the DAFI token for governance and collateralize the creation of dDAFI, the first synthetic unit which is tied to network demand. The quantity of the synthetic can increase only as network adoption rises – incentivizing longer-term users. Dafi is based on core economic principles, including: 1. Reducing the number of network rewards initially, as demand is too low. This would only lead to supply-shocks and risks, such as single-user control of network value. 2. Increasing issuance of tokens only as adoption rises – forming a direct link between these two market-factors for a better, healthy growth of decentralized economies. 3. Enhancing scarcity when networks decline in demand, to protect an economy, an adaptive response is required to prevent an over-release of tokens. Even during low demand periods, users are still rewarded for participation later – when demand rises.   DAFI MARKETING STRATEGY Dafi solves a pain-point, for both projects (which want to reward users without destroying a token) and users (the current model only favors short term participants). If a project has a token, they can create a dToken with Dafi. Even as low as 0.1% of their supply can be used. Meaning, the strategy is not to tackle replacing staking or liquidity incentives straight away. The best strategy is to start small, allow for a protocol to issue out a synthetic reward tied to the adoption/demand of their network - for bounty purposes. There was a time when bounties used to work, but economically they make no sense. It became an expensive user acquisition strategy. Dafi allows projects to distribute a reduced quantity of synthetics instead and allow that quantity to grow only as the demand of the network grows. Meaning short-term users burn the synthetic for a low end-token quantity. Longer-term users hold onto the synthetic and are rewarded through the adoption of the network (synthetic quantity expanding). WHAT MAKES DAFI PROTOCOL UNIQUE? Dafi creates a plug-and-play solution, which is simple to use for most networks, with minor changes in their architecture. The synthetics are represented as tokens that are governed by smart contracts that adjust their quantity relative to the chosen network demand. Projects lock the amount of tokens they desire and create a number of dTokens based on (current demand/baseline demand) * Synthetic quantity. Demand itself can be modified to select a range of variables to suit each token economy, including: Price (the most significant weight, to calculate a demand factor)On-chain volume (TX quantities)Transaction value (Beckstrom's law, the value of TX's minus cost of TX's)Off-chain volume (a chosen CEX)Nodes (Metcalfe's law, nodes quantity squared, n2)TVL (Value locked in the network e.g. in Staking contracts) Dafi is implementing demand as a condition for network rewards, because that is what markets are controlled by, not time.  DAFI PRODUCT ROADMAP  DAFI REVENUE STREAMS  DAFI TECHNOLOGIES USED BY THE PROJECT Ethereum Network Dafi uses Ethereum blockchain as their core blockchain network. This blockchain has the largest ecosystem of protocols for implementations with Dafi. Dafi will later implement a chain compatibility solution for protocols to create synthetics.

Yield Protocol lets anyone deploy algorithmic DeFi Strategies in an open-source platform that allows anybody to create and execute Yield Farming and Lending strategies within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. The first product built on Yield Protocol is YieldShield.com YieldShield is an algorithmic DeFi farmer that began its development in September 2020. It applies the data analytics standards of the multi-billion dollar high-frequency trading to DeFi farming. This allows for maximum profits on yield farms, in deposited currency functions through a dedicated smart contract for each user's risk shielding through a stop-loss function on farms. YieldShield allows every user to create a unique smart contract for themself, with each smart contract also acting as a dedicated Robo-farmer. The smart contract is also custom-built according to the risk-preference of the user. The contract immediately adjusts to higher profiting farms, is not shared with other users (increasing security), and builds a stop loss function for farmers. YIELD PROTOCOL MARKETING STRATEGY The global Robo advisory market size was valued at $4.51 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $41.07 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 31.8% from 2020 to 2027. In 2020, the industry reached $1.4trn in Assets Under Management. Yield Protocol is targeting crypto savvy users and DeFi traders around the globe, with the goal of capturing a fair market share. Initial Phase The project will focus primarily on DeFi users, building up a strong community, while partnering with top industry players in different regions. All these together, along with the Public Sale will raise the awareness of Yield Protocol. Development Phase In this phase, the team will develop and launch several products on various Networks (BSC, Avalanche, PolkaDot, etc.), targeting a wider crypto audience, growing user base and increasing the critical mass. Growth Phase Ramp up phase, through intensive marketing campaigns, PR, KOLs and Partnership. Yield protocol will scale-up user acquisition, making the company profitable and sustainable in the long term. WHAT MAKES YIELD PROTOCOL UNIQUE? Yield Protocol brings Robo-advisors to the DeFi space, letting anyone create and automate investment strategies such as Yield Farming and Lending, in a non-custody environment. There is a set of smart contracts that were created to enable it: 1. Factory Smart Contract - The factory smart contract is owned by the strategy creators (YieldShield), this contract: a) creates a personal contract b) keeps addresses of personal contracts c) Keeps addresses of investing contracts d) keeps whitelisted pools and tokens 2. Personal smart contract - This is deployed by the user, and their address is the only one that can withdraw the funds from it. The Personal contract receives commands from the Factory contract on where and how much of the funds should be invested in a farming pool and sends those funds through another smart contract - the Investing Contracts, that automates several actions. 3. The Investing Contract - This contract is made in order to automate several actions - Buying the necessary tokens, adding liquidity to the AMM pool and staking the liquidity tokens on farms. Those actions usually require between 5-7 separate transactions. The investing contracts aggregate those transactions together, making it more gas efficient and more user-friendly. 4. The pool contract - The pool contract is designed to allow products and communities to invest together, and save on gas costs. The pool contract will have set parameters, such as Farming strategy, Time limit, Min/Max investment, and other parameters that will allow users to invest in the same strategy and save a lot of money on gas fees.  YIELD PROTOCOL PRODUCT ROADMAP  WHAT ARE THE REVENUE STREAMS FOR YIELD PROTOCOL?  WHAT ARE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY YIELD PROTOCOL? Ethereum Blockchain Yield Protocol uses the Ethereum blockchain as the core network, which has the highest number of DeFi protocols built upon it, hence highest protocol aggregation in order to provide the best APYs to its users.

Xend Finance is the first protocol to target a market sector with over $2.2 Trillion of AUM in global credit unions. Centralized and fiat savings platforms are always limited by fees and cross border payments regulations that limit investing in other countries. The Xend Finance decentralized Credit Union protocol is built to optimize, improve and add value to the core operations of credit unions globally, removing the barriers of traditional finance and providing decentralized savings, lending, borrowing and investment operations of credit unions as well as providing multi-level interest returns to members of these unions. The native network token ($XEND) is used to reward users for saving, investing and performing different operations on the network. XEND is also used to purchase insurance and protect assets within the protocol. Xend Finance allows Credit Union and individual saving operations to become automated via smart contracts. The system charges credit unions a small fee to create a union and a fee per complete save cycle, which is paid in $XEND. A percentage of the fee is burned, to reduce the circulating supply, and help to pay the first level of interest to holders. The smart contract periodically invests user savings (deposits) on DeFi lending protocols such as Compound, AAVE, & Yearn Finance Protocol, therefore producing the second level of interest for users. The protocol currently supports the Ethereum Network and Binance Smart Chain. WHAT MAKES XEND FINANCE UNIQUE? Xend Finance belongs to the Xend ecosystem which has over 55,000 users currently. The ecosystem already consists of two products: Xend: An application for sending and receiving money online and offline. Geena: Business and analytics tool used by SMEs. These two products will help greatly with the onboarding on Xend Finance from non-crypto users, giving them more value than current outdated and centralized solutions. Xend Finance: a DeFi platform for cooperatives and credit unions that provides multi-levels of interest by optimizing and aggregating different DeFi lending protocols with the aim of providing high, yet stable currency yields and token rewards to the financially underserved living in unstable economies, allowing anyone from any region of the world to participate. The SDK will allow other financial services companies to build on top of the protocol, increasing the potential for customer acquisition and at the same time granting them access to DeFi features such as high APYs and global stablecoins less prone to value depreciation than the exotic fiat currencies in their home jurisdictions. Currently, there is a Testnet for Xend Finance built on the Binance Smart Chain.  XEND FINANCE PRODUCT ROADMAP  XEND FINANCE REVENUE STREAMS  WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES XEND FINANCE USE? Ethereum Blockchain The project uses Ethereum blockchain as the core blockchain network. The Ethereum blockchain has the highest number of DeFi lending protocols and gives Xend Finance more protocols to aggregate in order to provide best APYs to its users. Binance Smart Chain Binance Smart Chain is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain that runs in parallel with the Binance Chain that enables smart contracts. It is very fast (produces a block every 3 seconds), it is EVM-compatible, it has very low gas-fees, and it supports cross-chain asset transfers. Solidity The team is using this high-level programming language for Xend Token Smart Contract, Governor Smart Contract and Time Lock Smart Contract. web3.js - Ethereum JavaScript API Collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket, allowing users to interact with the platform seamlessly. Ganache Ganache is a development tool that is used to make a fork of the mainnet of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain to allow Xend Finance protocol to be tested with all mainnet parameters but on a local blockchain. Truffle Used to build and deploy automated tests for testing the protocol. XEND FINANCE MARKETING STRATEGY The first DeFi credit union or cooperative platform in the world targeting a market worth over $1.4 Trillion with over 250m annual members globally. Xend Finance targets crypto & non-crypto savvy users with a geographical focus on developing countries, where the banking system is not able to provide proper financial services to millions of underbanked or unbanked citizens - areas ripe for disruption by DeFi projects in the near future. The goal is to secure 10% of the credit union market. Initial Phase: The project will focus on DeFi and crypto audiences, raising market awareness, building up a strong community for the Token Generation Event, introducing Xend Finance to different communities in different regions of the world and forming strategic partnerships with different key players in these regions. These strategic partners will help to drive market education and increase the adoption rate. Development Phase: Go mainstream phase throughout the development of web and mobile SDKs to completely abstract the complexity of building on the blockchain, hence making it easy for both Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 application developers to integrate and expose their users to DeFi. Growth Phase: Scale-up user acquisition and Xend Finance platform integration exponentially by starting with the existing user base of over 55,000 users in the Xend ecosystem. The simple and responsive UX, and easy to integrate SDK will facilitate the onboarding of non-crypto savvy users, thus bringing over liquidity from the non-crypto world.

VAIOT, the first-ever regulated crypto project in Malta, was founded in 2018, and launched the Proof of Concept project in collaboration with IBM during Q4 2019 – Q1 2020. VAIOT combines AI & Blockchain to develop IVAs – Intelligent Virtual Assistants, for both consumers and businesses. The main difference between VAIOT and Siri or Alexa is that VAIOT was created to digitise business processes such as buying insurance or creating legal agreements. The project offers a brand new digital channel for the distribution of products and services and communication with consumers and the building of personal AI legal, contracts and transaction assistants providing legal services, including digital, blockchain-based contracts. The blockchain plays a vital role in both the solutions offered by VAIOT and the overall ecosystem with use cases ranging from recording contract and insurance policy data on-chain in addition to using the VAI Token economy to incentivise the utilization of such products. As a result, VAIOT solutions are supported by a token economy based on VAI Tokens, encouraging the use of Intelligent Virtual Assistants due to incentives such as the Payback Program fueled by VAIs. VAIOT MARKETING STRATEGY The VAIOT Platform will offer the market business solutions focusing on two areas: AI-based legal services.A novel, intelligent service distribution channel. VAIOT has designed three business lines: Virtual AI Sales Assistant - A new digital intelligent sales channel.Virtual AI Aggregator & Broker (Recommendation and Sales Assistant) - A new digital intelligent customer service tool.Virtual AI Legal Assistant and AI Legal Oracle - A new digital intelligent legal assistant with the capability to generate contracts and conclude secure transactions. The project aims to enhance several industries, including, at first, insurance services, financial services, legal services, including computer-assisted legal research services, as well as Consumer to Consumer (C2C) commercial contracts and transactions. The solutions will be both B2B (VAIOT as a solution enhancing service distribution, sales, and customer service processes for companies) as well as B2C (VAIOT as an open application for the consumers to allow wider B2C and C2C transactions). WHAT MAKES VAIOT UNIQUE? VAIOT has already developed a working software beta for insurance companies that is already used to secure deals with the first clients in few sectors. The Beta was tested by a group of 50 community testers selected from VAIOT's community. A client can use VAIOT's technology to have their own AI assistant delivered to consumers via a mobile app to potentially increase sales, revenues, or to reduce costs. These are not simple chatbots; and VAIOT allows the consumers to use a Natural User Interface, including speech recognition for voice conversation with the AI assistant that for example, suggests suitable products or services based on customer requirements. This can work as an Intelligent, digital sales channel or a customer service tool. The MVP and BETA versions which have already been released were built by the VAIOT team based on the PoC project conducted jointly with its partner IBM. The BETA is already used to pitch first clients in the insurance, and also pitching HR and Voice Commerce clients. The product BETA has been available on the VAIOT website since the end of September for closed beta testing.  VAIOT PRODUCT ROADMAP  VAIOT REVENUE STREAMS The company extracts revenue from the products offered to the market across 3 business lines; business line 1 – revenue from commercial b2b contracts + implementation fees; business line 2 – revenue from each transaction made through an assistant (e.g. insurance policy sold); business line 3 – revenue from each transaction and/or each intelligent contract generated/each use of an AI Legal Oracle.Transaction fees and contract deployment fees are transferred to the VAIOT ecosystem where they are distributed to the validators.Brokerage profit for nodes offering price peg during VAI Token payments in VAIOT Value Assurance System (VVAS).Payment for a request to AI Legal Oracle will be gathered in VAI Tokens.Token transfers from the Payback Wallet to the VAIOT Wallet generate a fixed percentage fee distributed to the Growth Pool.

My Neighbor Alice is a multiplayer builder game, where anyone can buy and own virtual islands, collect and build exciting items and meet new friends. Inspired by successful games such as Animal Crossing, the game combines the best of the two worlds - a fun narrative for regular players who want to enjoy the gameplay experience as well as an ecosystem for players who want to collect and trade NFTs. My Neighbor Alice is not just a game for blockchain players, but is in fact a game that will introduce blockchain technology to millions of players. MY NEIGHBOUR ALICE'S MARKETING STRATEGY The High-level strategy for building end-user communities will include a detailed marketing strategy with a number of tactical milestones and activities, such as market analysis, branding and positioning, media involvement, PR, social media marketing, A/B testing for different target groups and initial user research. The goal is to build a strong and motivated community of players, crypto enthusiasts and those interested in DeFi. The initial community marketing roadmap, leading up to the early access of the game, is focusing on Social media marketing with an emphasis on Youtube, Twitter, Discord. KOL marketing, having already partnered with the representatives from Blockchain Gaming Alliance and Cross-promotion taking advantage of the existing communities of Antler Interactive and Chromia. WHAT MAKES MY NEIGHBOUR ALICE UNIQUE? The game offers a new, great way of connecting an exciting game narrative with blockchain features and in-game DeFi elements, offering exclusive game tools such as the NFT creator and Game Builder which have the potential to significantly advance the gameplay experience for both players and developers. My Neighbor Alice includes Chromia Originals, an innovative protocol for creating and issuing NFTs, which offers a more extensive and complex functionality than standard NFTs. In this respect, My Neighbor Alice will be able to store much more data about items on-chain. Also, the logic of items will be designed in an open-source game, running on-chain and being under the ultimate control of the players with the help of the DAO. Rich NFT DeFi functionalities. The other innovation in the game is its decentralised governance model and DAO driven game development. ALICE token holders will be invited to join the Decentralised Autonomous Organization called the Community Council. Players get to vote on important game proposals and issues, additional functionality, new NFTs and approving NFTs created by users with the help of an NFT creator. The inspiration for the Community Council was taken from real-world experience with liquid democracy models.  MY NEIGHBOUR ALICE PRODUCT ROADMAP  MY NEIGHBOUR ALICE REVENUE STREAMS  HOW DOES MY NEIGHBOUR ALICE PRODUCT WORK? My Neighbor Alice will be a free to play cross-platform multiplayer game which allows you to seamlessly play along with your friends regardless of which platform they or you are on. This gives the game a competitive edge against other games in the genre such as Animal Crossing: New Horizons which is a premium game and only on Nintendo Switch or Stardew Valley which is a premium game and these games have a higher barrier to entry than a free to play game like My Neighbor Alice. There is a lot to do inside the game world, and the ability to build combined with social features as the main focus presents a nice change from farming. The game is taken from a well-used formula but makes subtle changes that make it stand out from the crowd and distinguish itself when compared to similar games like My Time at Portia. WHAT ARE THE TECHNOLOGIES USED BY MY NEIGHBOUR ALICE PROJECT?

The Seascape Network gaming platform leverages gamification, DeFi, and NFTs to forge an incentivized ecosystem for crypto gamers, developers and influencers. The core team behind Seascape are the creators of the popular blockchain game BLOCKLORDS, a pioneering cross-chain strategy game. The team's primary goal is to create a gaming platform that enables the publishing of excellent games and users to monetize their playing time, earning Crowns and NFTs. Users will also be able to take loans via collateralized debt positions (CDP) and staking NFTs. The Crown token acts as the core mechanism of the platform, and focuses on usability and quality, fueling Seascape's whole ecosystem. Both users and game developers will be rewarded with Crowns tokens, which helps to build an environment, where everyone: users, developers and stakeholders plays, earns and shares experiences in an incentivized way. Furthermore, Crowns token owners will receive weekly rewards from BLOCKLORDS' gaming fees. WHAT MAKES SEASCAPE UNIQUE? DeFi concepts like Staking, CDPs, and Yield Farming are not new to the crypto community, but the Seascape ecosystem will integrate them in a polished UX, adding gamification mechanics, to incentivize primary users (DeFi traders, gamers) and developers, to play and trade assets in its marketplace. BLOCKLORDS, the company's flagship game, serves as proof of concept for community incentives, Crowns Staking, and CDPs and the novel concept of Player Created Coin (PCC), which lets players create their in-game currency. NFTs will be used as collateral for taking loans, rented out, or traded on the marketplace. These are going to be burned, once rewards are claimed, thus increasing the share of NFTs left in the pool, creating a balance between Crows and NFTs, which benefits both holders and users. Furthermore, the Scape store will reward DOT stakers with Crowns, subsidized on-chain transactions, a share of profit from the games, and access to all Scape games for free or discounted prices. These stakes will ensure stability and scalability in the Polkadot Network.  SEASCAPE PRODUCT ROADMAP  SEASCAPE REVENUE STREAMS The business model is split into two streams: Games publishing sales through the Seascape Store, where users can choose from monthly subscription or individual transactions, and DeFi System fees coming from NFTs DEX transactions and NFTs lending rates. Platform fees can be paid in Crowns and they will be redistributed to token holders and games will have in-game rewards. Games published by third-party developers will receive a fairer share than current market competitors.   WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES SEASCAPE USE? Player Created Coins (PCC) Players and developers can create their tokens backed by Crowns to serve as the underlying currency for certain games. Random Number Generator (RNG) on Substrate Current available options like Chainlink VRF are inefficient and expensive. Developing a fair and inexpensive RNG is going to add a lot of value to the games and other dapps in the substrate ecosystem. New Substrate NFT Standard This new standard allows NFT to be created and deployed in a more scalable and optimized manner, reducing the user's minting cost. Token Bridge for NFTs and ERC-20 form ETH to Substrate (ice chain) All ERC-721 NFTs and ERC-20 tokens will be transferable from Ethereum Network to Substrate thanks to the ice chain Token Bridge. New NFT Decentralized exchange A proprietary NFT DEX based on the Substrate blockchain will let users trade their non-fungible tokens on an open market, easily and cheaply. SEASCAPE MARKETING STRATEGY The global gaming industry rose 7.8% YoY in 2019 reaching the staggering figure of $148.8 billion spent on gaming. The top 5 publishers netted $13+ billion and there is an expected CAGR of 12% for the forecast period of 2020-2025. The decentralized loans market niche posed a meteoric rise in 2020, reaching $3.25 billion of outstanding debt in December. The primary commercial goals are unifying DeFi and gaming, levering the best of both markets. The platform means to solve three important current obstacles: the deficit of incentives to attract non-blockchain users, the lack of scalable DeFi and NFT solutions, and the absence of fair and cost-effective platforms for game developers. Initial Phase: Focus on DeFi and NFT audiences, raising market awareness, building up a strong community for the Token Generation Event. Development Phase: Creation of developer tools and SDKs for Substrate and the Polkadot Network. Also, releasing NFTs and CDP gaming products. Plus, onboarding of new developers and Scape Store brand new games releases. Expansion Phase: Ramp up user acquisition and games publishing at a large-scale. Removing blockchain barriers seamlessly, thanks to a polished and responsive UX, facilitating the onboarding of non-crypto users, thus increasing user-flow and retention, while keeping monetization smooth.

88	dao-maker	3900000	87	Launchpad	0	0	0.0	0.0	dao-maker	09/02/21	ethereum	95	2	WHAT IS DAO MAKER? DAO Maker is building the go-to platform for retail venture investing in equity and tokens. Providing low-risk participation frameworks is essential to reach global retail in venture capital, as most retail investors cannot afford to risk large portions of their money. By providing an opportunity to everyday people to safely grow their own capital, we aim to improve the quality of millions of lives, while simultaneously enabling a new funding source for innovation worldwide. Over the past 3 years, DAO Maker has grown one of the largest ecosystems of quality retail investors; just in 2020, our platform signed on more than 75,000 retail users interested in early-stage ventures; lately this figure reached 200,000+ KYC'ed users. At the same time, we have been building a suite of services to attract high-quality startups to join the ecosystem and be accelerated in a decentralised, safe, and autonomous environment. Some of the industry's most notable developments currently use the technology solutions provided within our startup growth toolkit. To date, the demand for the products has well exceeded our ability to manage on-boarding flow, which is why we are currently working on permission-less, self-managed versions of our technology products. DAO Maker's track record has defied market cycles. We have worked with projects to design solutions to raise capital in bear markets, supported enterprise blockchains to generate new product portfolios for growth, and created technology solutions that expand community empowerment in tokenised developments. Our consulting and technology services' revenue has been funnelled to our primary goal: creating a globally compliant fundraising platform for both crowd equity and tokens. Our approach to a fundraising platform is distinct from other platforms that target venture funding. We don't just connect retail venture funds to startups in need of capital. Instead, we create a platform that incorporates pluggable solutions to the problems early-stage ventures face after fundraising, alongside creating venture investment structures that make participation far safer for retail. DAO Maker is on track to change the way personal finance works by breaking its boundaries. While retail or household portfolios have made record participation into the equity market, encouraged by a global desire for individuals to seek financial independence by putting their money to work, retail involvement in venture funding is bleak. DAO MAKER MARKETING STRATEGY DAO Maker is a company that has successfully operated in the funding, tech consulting, and product strategy segments of the cryptocurrency market for over three years. DAO Maker benefits from the existing base of over 200,000 cryptocurrency investors signed up to our current platform. This massive base of cryptocurrency holders, who are also interested in venture capital, is a powerful go-to-market. While the existing base provides the critical mass needed to catapult this venture, the project aims to tap beyond the crypto market, and onboard new retail, by offering not a mere 8%-10% on DeFi and CeFi involvement, but a 10x to 100x multiple of this. 10% of principal (interest on principal) directed at a startup that achieves 10x is a 100% return on capital.10% of principal (interest on principal) directed at a startup that achieves 100x is a 1,000% return on capital. It is the opportunity of exposure to such venture capital returns that are necessary to capture the interest of mass retail. The current sustainable state of DeFi and CeFi returns has been 8% to 10%, a return that is already accessible in traditional finance, per the rolling 10-year return of the S&P500. 8% to 10% return on capital is not exciting, but a possible 1,000% through exposure to venture capital is exciting. It is also the only way to sustainably offer the potential of high yield in DeFi/CeFi. DAO Maker stands at the forefront of structuring such products and then targeting them for mass access. FIAT tie-in with the Euro was committed earlier this year. We recently achieved the ability to legally support FIAT purchases on the platform. The company intends to acquire licenses for supporting USD, CAD, HKD, SGD, and AED as-well, with specific countries having exposure to either equity or tokens, and some countries having access to both per legal support. WHAT MAKES DAO MAKER UNIQUE? Retail makes up less than 1% of the annual $300B venture capital market, even though early-stage investments are the leading wealth generator, as growth prospects are becoming increasingly limited by the time new companies listed on the market. Personal finance is witnessing a golden era. Portfolio management has quickly evolved from a service provided by brokers and dedicated asset managers into an app on peoples’ smart-phones. Fractional real estate, fractional stocks, tap-and-launch equity options, and virtually every other major asset is already easily in the hands of retail through simple apps. Venture capital, though, remains elusive for most retail. Yet, it is arguably the greatest tool for wealth creation. Venture capital is the next frontier in personal finance. The market is currently either crypto native or select mass retail that participates in equity crowdfunding. It is a functionally flawed approach as the current risk scale is beyond the capacity of most retail. DAO Maker brings the simplicity and ease of participation that retail seeks to venture capital. Simultaneously, the downside-capped nature of the venture investment opportunities it opens aligns with the risk-averse nature of retail.  DAO MAKER PRODUCT ROADMAP DAO MAKER REVENUE STREAMS DAO Maker is a cash-flow-positive and self-funded company since late 2018. DAO Maker crossed $1.7M in 2020 revenue, from technology product offerings, consulting services, incubations, and enterprise offerings. dTeams Atlas: Subscription modelExpress: Percentage of volume YieldShield Fee on distributionFee on liquidity lock Managed Funding - Tokens Percentage of raisePercentage of token supply Platform for Compliant Raise - Tokens Percentage of raise and/or tokensFlat Compliance Fee Platform for Compliant Raise - Equity Percentage of raisePercentage of equityFlat Compliance Fee Services Lending: 5% fee on interest paid on margin used for DYCO VB Exchange Token: trading feeEquity (accredited only): 1% - 2% fee HOW DOES DAO MAKER WORK? DAO Maker has been working on launching a single platform that offers venture funding in tiered risk levels. In the meantime, we have put our theory of retail being excited to participate in venture funding if the risk level can be reduced. The first DYCO, which was essentially a risk-capped venture opportunity, quickly raised $3.5M from retail and then hit extreme oversubscription. The DYCO captured market participation at a time when token funding was at an all-time low, and most VCs had told us the raise would go dry. This was before the DeFi hype-rally. However, we were confident that the problem was not a lack of retail interest, but a need for risk reduction to fit the risk tolerance levels of most retail. The DYCO's success is proof that capping risk in venture capital is the pathway to bringing mass retail interest into venture funding. We are launching a FIAT-enabled compliant platform for venture funding, both crowd equity and tokens. It involves tiered levels of risk to cater to the varying levels of risk appetite that retail has. The platform will include:  Venture Bond for near-zero risk, but with reduced rewards Dynamic Equity/Coin Offerings for capped risk while maintaining most of the reward Refundable Strong Holder Offerings & Strong Holder Offerings for public sales of tokens that have successfully closed a private round Standard Offerings for equity/token issuance without any protection, for retail with maximum risk appetite  The platform will support FDIC-insured stablecoins and FIAT, with the first one being the Euro. User access to equity or token offerings will depend on their jurisdiction, but most countries will be able to access both. Our intent is to create a single platform that offers retail early stage exposure to startups that are working on the future of everything from finance and insurance to healthcare and transportation. Some of these are best if issued with equity, while others are best if issued with tokens. While their nature as early stage ventures will carry risk, the framework with which the platform will conduct the fundraise will enable varying levels of downside protection. The DYCO already has some popularity within the cryptocurrency space.The Dynamic Coin Offerings allows a startup to raise funds while holding them accountable by giving DYCO participants the right to claim refunds at specific milestone dates. This means the project has to perform at a level that keeps their community convinced in the project's prospects and longevity. The rSHO, or refundable Strong Holder Offering, is a funding focused at seeding projects with communities if they have filled private rounds with VCs. The Venture Bond is going to be our new flagship product, an almost risk-free investment for risk-averse investors. DAO Maker not only offers structured a funding platform, but very valuable solutions for community development and governance: Social Mining: it allows companies to categorise acquired holders, and to further vet, train, and deploy these users as skilled contributors to the ecosystem. dTeams: is Social Mining on Steroids. A direct plug in for companies yearning for rapid progress, resembling the ideal infrastructure boost and allows easy monitoring through it's universally applicable CRM approach. Staking 2.0 & YieldShield: A permission-less toolkit, which allows tokenised startups to monitor and grow the secondary market involvement of their users. It is powered by our chain analysis tools, with the addition of new resources that make participation in liquidity mining safer and free of smart contract risk. Elrond, Ecomi, NEM and Avalanche are some of the examples of how DAO Maker fosters community and valuation growth through its different solutions.

PlotX is a non-custodial prediction protocol that enables crypto traders to participate and earn rewards on high-yield prediction markets. Dubbed as the Uniswap of Prediction Markets, PlotX uses an Automated Market Making algorithm for market creation & settlement, as well as distributing rewards on the Ethereum Blockchain without any counterparty risk. Markets are focused on crypto-pairs like BTC, ETH, YFI etc and are automatically created in intervals of 1h, 1d and 1w. PlotX also uses on-chain governance powered by GovBlocks. PLOTX MARKETING STRATEGY ? Prediction markets are a way to sum opinions of many and capture what is known as the ""wisdom of the crowd"". To be able to achieve that, it is critical for PlotX to reach the masses. If the community is able to achieve that, a new version of information will be created that is driven by true crowd opinions. In order to attract the wisdom of the crowd PlotX aims to solve the challenges faced by traditional centralized prediction markets. There are 3 core challenges that PlotX solves: counterparty risk, high cost and inability to showcase provably fair settlements of markets. The DeFi ecosystem is yet to innovate with crypto-native prediction markets. Early attempts to launch Prediction Markets on Ethereum have suffered due to a lack of focus on building crypto-native markets and a lack of maturity of the ecosystem back in 2017/2018. PlotX is a DeFi prediction protocol that is native to the crypto community, with the following key parameters: Predictions for only the price of digital assets like BTC, ETH, YFI etc to begin withOn-chain market creation using AMM driven smart contracts, unlike market creation by individual users with no uniformityOn-chain price per position calculation and instant purchase instead of creation of low liquidity order booksOn-chain market settlement wrapped in a gamified experience with 'Participation Mining' PlotX Community stands by the ethos of Abraham Lincoln's very famous saying: ""The best way to predict your future is to create it"". A critical aspect of PlotX growth is to drive education and research for the community to understand the value add and also the risks associated with prediction markets. PlotX community members are called PLOT Heads and they are the driving force behind the PlotX movement. The PLOT Head community follows the 2ED principle - Educate, Engage & Drive adoption Educate: Driving education about PlotX, explaining the utilities of the protocol, product's vision and the risks associated with prediction markets.Engage: Introducing ideas and complementary skills to what PlotX is today with a vision of furthering the attempt at driving adoption.Drive adoption: Use the protocol responsibly and invite peer networks to do the same while explaining the risks. WHAT MAKES PLOT X UNIQUE ? Existing platforms like Synthetix, Augur and others have done a great job at kickstarting the innovation behind prediction markets. However, these projects were unable to bootstrap liquidity and provide seamless user experience in their attempts. PlotX aims to solve these shortcomings with the following key features: Risk Deleverage PlotX also provides risk deleverage that allows users to limit their risks while buying positions, unlike traditional all-in binary options. On-Chain Governance The protocol & dApp follow a pragmatic on-chain governance approach, powered by the GovBlocks smart contracts (the solution used by Nexus Mutual). Liquidity Mining via Yield Farming for Liquidity Providers To bootstrap and encourage liquidity for the PLOT token, users who stake their PLOT tokens on specified PLOT liquidity pools on DEXs (to be announced) will be incentivised by providing extra PLOT tokens as rewards for providing liquidity. To earn the yield farming rewards, liquidity providers on DEXs will have to lock their LP tokens on PlotX Staking Smart Contract. The yield farming incentives will be distributed per second with no limitation on minimum staking days. Play Mining Users are incentivized to stake their PLOT tokens prior to participating in the prediction market, in order to earn extra positions and thus extra rewards via the stake multiplier. The best part being, even if users lose in the prediction market, they will not lose the staked PLOT tokens. PLOTX PRODUCT ROADMAP  PLOT X REVENUE STREAMS PlotX is a DAO with a vision to become self-sustainable and fully decentralized over a period of time - which means that neither PlotX nor the developers of PlotX benefit from or receive any fees from trades, predictions or any other kind of user activity on the platform. The vision is to use the transaction fee to make the DAO self-sustainable in times to come in the spirit of ""ownership economy"". From day 1, transaction fee from the markets is collected by a non-custodial smart contract to incentivise the community members of the DAO to perform various activities like the live market creation transactions. A DAO will be set up on the day 1 of the launch to drive community governance on the platform. The funds generated from the transaction will be controlled by the DAO. Decisions to utilize these funds as well as supporting further development & maintenance would be made by the DAO itself. The DAO would be powered by GovBlocks smart contracts. HOW DOES PLOT X WORK ? PlotX aims to allow the users to achieve two things: Participate in high-yield prediction markets to earn rewards.Take part in decision making via Community governance These are achieved by the following products: PlotX Prediction Protocol Automated Market Making with on-chain transactions, settlement and reward distributionFocussed on crypto traders, providing them with high-yield markets in a gamified experienceAbility to participate in multiple crypto-pair (BTC-USDT, ETH-USDT) markets and take entry via ETH or PLOT PlotX Positions Trading Engine Allowing trade of positions with other usersParticipants will be able to liquidate positions even before they expire On-Chain Governance with Dispute Resolution Pragmatic approach to on-chain governance via community participationAllowing PLOT token holders to create proposals and voteDecisions like new markets (crypto-pair additions), smart code logic modifications or other feature requests will be facilitated by the communityCommunity driven dispute resolution in case of disputes in market settlement PlotX Meridian Automated market making algo for market creationEnabling the creation of markets that attract traders and volumeIngesting data and calling partner APIs and performance of Technical and Sentiment AnalysisMultiple fail-safes for every datapointMultiple factor-driven market Initiation algo for maximum participation TECHNOLOGIES USED AND CREATED BY PLOT X AMM Protocol Automated Market Making algo (Meridian) enables automatic creation of prediction markets with options & odds calculation without the need of a counterparty. The AMM ensures a provably fair, decentralized and open finance solution for prediction market creation, settlement and reward distribution using smart contracts. Ethereum Smart Contracts PlotX is comprised of a set of open-source smart contracts written using Solidity that emulate the features of a prediction market with a vision of providing a fair, decentralized and open finance solution. The PlotX smart contracts can be seen at: https://github.com/plotx/smart-contracts Web3 Integration PlotX is a non-custodial prediction protocol. To participate in prediction markets, users will have to connect via their Metamask wallet or any of the mobile wallets supported by WalletConnect. PLOT X TOKEN ECONOMY PlotX is built by and for the Ethereum community. Ability to use all DeFi applications in ETH should be a right for the community. With this strong belief, the protocol has been designed in a way that people can predict using ETH and the PlotX native token. The value proposition of the PlotX native token (PLOT) is as follows:           "	8003	0.0012495314257153568	0.00012495314257153568	0.001124578283143821

Powered by blockchain technology, DeFiner's decentralized financial (DeFi) platform enables users to effortlessly lend, borrow, and earn digital assets within a global network. DeFiner removes the friction and costs associated with conventional financial services and instead offers maximum flexibility to set one's own rates and terms. DeFiner also removes the need for third parties from its financial ecosystem, by using an immutable blockchain to track all loans and transactions, providing ultimate security for users. By providing 24/7 global accessibility with significantly lower costs than traditional finance, DeFiner allows those embracing the new, digital economy to unlock instant value from their assets. WHAT MAKES DEFINER UNIQUE? Crypto lending is an established market facing rapid growth. Decentralized lenders have reached valuations in the billions, despite lacking the framework needed to service the industry's main borrowers, i.e. institutions, and inexperienced retail, which is the single largest growth segment. CeFi lending has ballooned to a multi-billion dollar business as-well, despite its many drawbacks and limitations. Exchanges take huge cuts from depositors' yield, lack transparency, and almost never offer insurance on deposits. Centralized lenders, such as BlockFi, remain intransparent and siloed, limiting the maximum yield depositors could have. DeFiner takes what works in decentralized and centralized crypto lending and delivers it in one platform: on-chain transparency, automated insurance, aggregation for maximized yield, and an institutional-use ready OTC module.         DEFINER PRODUCT ROADMAP   DEFINER MARKETING STRATEGY Lending markets remain a quintessential aspect of the cryptocurrency market, and they stem well beyond provision of margin to traders. The dominant players in lending are exchanges, a small number of DeFi platforms, and established centralized lenders. Meanwhile, the primary target market is retail traders, institutional traders, and miners. Over the past two years, DeFiner has worked to combine the best competitive advantages each current market player provides, and offers it in a single product. Retail Traders Retail traders are careful on middleman fees and hence have become the primary customer of DeFi platforms. DeFiner offers this market segment exactly what they seek: maximized APR for lenders and minimized interest for lenders by aggregating multi-platform yield for unborrowed and excess collateral assets. Institutional Traders Institutional traders, while also careful of middleman fees, tend to have specialized agreements with exchanges and hence are less concerned about the middleman taking a slice. Their main concern is predictability on loan rate and loan period, as their trades carefully take into cost of margin and loan period. DeFiner's peer-to-peer fixed term, fixed rate loan option outdoes exchange lending for institutions in every way: institutions completely avoid the middleman fee while also enjoying the predictability of the loan terms that are critical to their operation. Institutional Borrowers (like miners) Institutional borrowers are large crypto-focused businesses, especially miners. Such businesses require large, long-term loans, often with flexible conditions to reflect unexpected fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin. Such businesses opt for OTC lending. With the help of DeFiner's strategic investor, Canaan, which is one of the largest miners in the world, DeFiner has developed solutions to support institutional borrowing in a DeFi platform, while reflecting all the necessary components such large borrowers seek. DeFiner is the first DeFi project to integrate OTC lending into an on-chain solution. As these OTC orders are handled through a marketplace, they are open to miners' dedicated lenders, and also to retail. This opens the reach of retail directly to institutional borrowers for the first time. Inexperienced Retail A growing segment in crypto loan is the inexperienced retail. This is, in fact, the greatest growth segment with room for exponential new user acquisition. Inexperienced retail, or the mass market, is highly risk averse and accustomed to convenience. Hence, they opt common onramps as their go-to for exposure to the DeFi market. This includes services like Coinbase, which offer a lowly 1% yield, alongside intransparent and centralized solutions like Celsius and BlockFi. Inexperienced retail opts for the options mentioned above because they offer automated deposit insurance. While DeFi insurance exists, it is far from automated and even further from convenience. DeFiner is redefining the DeFi experience by offering convenience and security, two factors that are otherwise laughed at in the DeFi's dog-eat-dog narrative. All accounts are given automated deposit insurance through our partnership with Nexus Mutual. All the decentralization, none of the inconvenience.

Orion Protocol aggregates the liquidity, order book depth, and trade pairs of every centralized exchange, decentralized exchange, and swap pool. It is the most advanced liquidity aggregator ever developed. By aggregating the liquidity of the entire crypto market into one decentralized platform, Orion Protocol solves the largest issues in DeFi. Governing the protocol is the proprietary staking mechanism Delegated Proof of Broker, fulfilling every function via a decentralized brokerage, with the ORN token at its core. This mechanism underpins each solution built on the protocol, including the flagship product Orion Terminal, which is an aggregation of all major exchanges' liquidity into one decentralized terminal. The Protocol's enables a rich product roadmap, including the Orion Enterprise, which provides much needed solutions for businesses in the space, including blockchains and exchanges, alongside an unrivaled price oracle and high-margin DEX. ORION PROTOCOL MARKETING STRATEGY  Virtually everyone involved with cryptocurrencies has to participate in trading. However, liquidity options in cryptocurrency come with trade-offs. Centralized exchanges take custody of user assets & they force users to hope from 1 brand to another, DEX lack liquidity, and swapping pools lack depth. Orion brings the benefits of all three in one platform by combining the liquidity and order books of every centralized exchange, DEX, and swap pool. This gives Orion a massive go-to market as: - Users of any CEX can still access the coins and liquidity of their CEX through Orion, but with even greater price discovery, liquidity, and depth, while also holding on to their assets - Users of any DEX get magnitudes greater liquidity without giving up their assets - Users of any Swap pool benefit from much lower fees without giving up their assets WHAT MAKES ORION PROTOCOL UNIQUE ? Liquidity aggregators already exist, and have displayed great demand. For example, Tagomi, a broker that functioned as a liquidity aggregator for institutions has been acquired by Coinbase for $100M, even though it only aggregates a few centralized markets. Meanwhile, decentralized liquidity aggregators, like 1inch.exchange and DEX.ag, process millions in volume even though they only aggregate the order books of decentralized exchanges and swap pools. Orion offers a non-custodial liquidity aggregator. This greatly reduces friction to user onboarding as people can use their current wallet and immediately tap into the liquidity of every CEX, DEX, and swap pool.    ORION PROTOCOL PRODUCT ROADMAP   ORION PROTOCOL REVENUE STREAMS   HOW DOES ORION PROTOCOL WORK ? The Orion Terminal and Orion Protocol are not the same. The Orion Protocol aggregates the liquidity, order book depth, and price discovery from every centralized and decentralized digital asset market. This enables the creation of the Orion Terminal, and an array of other much-needed products for consumers and businesses. - Orion Terminal - Orion Lending - Orion Margin Orion Enterprise exists to help businesses in the space build sustainable, decentralized ecosystems, giving them the liquidity, accessibility, and growth they need to succeed. - Orion Price Oracle - Orion DEX Kit - Orion Liquidity Boost Plugin - Orion Enterprise Widget Orion Terminal: Use any non-custodial wallet (i.e. MetaMask) to tap into 10,000+ coins sourced from every centralized exchange, DEX, and swap pool, from just 1 place. Users control their assets, pay low fees, pay the best available price for an asset, and benefit from the security of never giving up control of their assets. Orion Lending: Similar to how Orion terminal aggregates order books, Orion Lending aggregates lending APRs from centralized and decentralized providers to ensure both borrowers and lenders can seamlessly use the best available rate. Orion Margin: The lack of order book depth on decentralized platforms has hindered the creation of high-margin (ergo, 100x) trading on decentralized exchanges. However, Orion Protocol can enable such a service as it aggregates the liquidity and depth of centralized exchanges through a decentralized executions. Orion Price Oracle: Orion Protocol enables the market-leading price oracle that is resilient to price manipulation due to price derivation from every order book in the market. This is incredibly advantageous to external DeFi products that have been regularly exploited due to inefficiencies in price oracles. Orion DEX Kit: The Protocol is usable by anyone, but the team is leading the product development on it. To facilitate others seeking to use the protocol, a developer kit will be launched to expand Protocol use. Orion Liquidity Boost Plugin: A pluggable liquidity source to any centralized or decentralized market. Exchanges can utilize the Orion Plugin to improve their order book depth and liquidity. Orion Enterprise Widget: A middle layer between crypto projects with utility tokens and all available liquidity of the token on the markets. Tokenized projects' enterprise clients can purchase tokens directly from the project's platform or website by routing orders from all exchanges carrying the token, returning tokens for immediate use. The products mentioned above are the earliest release points in the Orion product roadmap. Through the DEX kit, talented developers will be able launch and benefit from their own product visions, while growing the Orion Protocol ecosystem. Furthermore, additional products enabled by the Protocol's ability to offer the ultimate source of liquidity are already in the planning stage, and will be announced after concept finalization. TECHNOLOGIES USED AND INNOVATIVE MECHANISMS CREATED BY ORION PROTOCOL Liquidity Aggregator Protocol The protocol standardizes connectivity to both centralized and decentralized exchanges, allowing all parties to participate in a trading workflow in a completely decentralized way. The protocol governs accounting and trade settlement that can be implemented on almost any public and enterprise blockchain. Decentralized Brokerage (Delegated Proof of Broker) Delegated Proof of Broker governs every function on the protocol from order execution, to clearing, to the governance of choosing a broker, and everything in between including via a decentralized brokerage with the native ORN token at its core. Designed using advantages from PoS, DPoB consists of two core components: Brokers and Non-Broker Stakers. Every transaction across the protocol acts as a trade being carried out by a broker via the decentralized exchange. Brokers earn rewards for conducting these trades: profit share from each transaction will be shared back in the form of ORN tokens. Smart Contracts Orion's innovative mutual credit accounting system implemented in different programming languages (including Solidity, Rust, etc) was specifically developed to be used in smart contracts on different platforms. This underpins Orion's blockchain-agnostic approach in exchange functionality that can be run on different blockchains. Order Matching Engine The high-performance Orion Matching Engine is built on the aggregated orderbook, updated from every connected exchange in real time. This fulfils splitting, routing and matching functions. Multi-Currency Wallet Orion wallet can be integrated into all familiar and widely-used wallets (including MetaMask, email/phone-based login, Test, etc.) and allows users to securely store their funds. This isn't limited to native ERC20 tokens, but includes synthetic tokens pegged 1:1 to native currencies on heterogeneous blockchains. This is implemented via Orion Token Bridge system built between different blockchains, including but not limited to Bitcoin and Bitcoin-like blockchains (BCH, BSV, LTC etc), Ethereum, ETC, EOS, NEO, Waves and others.
